        Builds a knowledge graph from text by extracting entities and relationships, then integrating them into a structured graph.
        This function leverages language models to extract and merge knowledge from multiple sections of text.

        Args:
        sections (List[str]): A list of strings where each string represents a section of the document from which entities 
                              and relationships will be extracted.
        existing_knowledge_graph (KnowledgeGraph, optional): An existing knowledge graph to merge the newly extracted 
                                                             entities and relationships into. Default is None.
        ent_threshold (float, optional): The threshold for entity matching, used to merge entities from different 
                                         sections. A higher value indicates stricter matching. Default is 0.7.
        rel_threshold (float, optional): The threshold for relationship matching, used to merge relationships from 
                                         different sections. Default is 0.7.
        entity_name_weight (float): The weight of the entity name, set to 0.6, indicating its
                                     relative importance in the overall evaluation process.
        entity_label_weight (float): The weight of the entity label, set to 0.4, reflecting its
                                      secondary significance in the evaluation process.
        max_tries (int, optional): The maximum number of attempts to extract entities and relationships. Defaults to 5.
        max_tries_isolated_entities (int, optional): The maximum number of attempts to process isolated entities 
                                                     (entities without relationships). Defaults to 3.

        KnowledgeGraph: A constructed knowledge graph consisting of the merged entities and relationships extracted 
                        from the text.
