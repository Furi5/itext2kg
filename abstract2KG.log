Abstract: Delirium has long been recognized within the adult intensive care world, but it is only within the past decade that its presence and prevalence in the context of pediatric intensive care has been studied. There is now a greater understanding of risk factors for delirium, a better selection of methods to recognize it, and treatment specifically directed to pediatric patients. An understanding of delirium is also relevant to pediatricians practicing outside of the intensive care unit, as delirium can present in other care environments, where it remains under-recognized. The purpose of this article is to review pediatric delirium by discussing its pathophysiology, the tools available to screen patients, and current prevention and management approaches.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the Delirium Diagnostic Tool-Provisional (DDT-Pro), a 0-9 point scale with three items each representing symptoms from delirium's three core domains, differentiates subsyndromal delirium (SSD) from delirium and no delirium. METHODS: We applied cluster analyses of DDT-Pro scores from 200 consecutive inpatients using three reference standards for delirium diagnosis to determine DDT-Pro cutoff values for delirium, SSD and no delirium groups. Clinical validators and DDT-Pro item scores were compared among groups. RESULTS: DDT-Pro SSD range was 6-7 (n = 54), with no delirium having higher scores (n = 98) and delirium lower (n = 48). Dementia prevalence in the SSD group (40.7%) was intermediate between no delirium (20.4%) and delirium (66.7%). SSD and delirium groups were more affected than no delirium regarding medical comorbidities, hospital stay (no delirium <1 week, SSD and delirium >1 week) and mortality (SSD = 7.4%, delirium = 18.8%, no delirium = 1%). Values for motor subtypes, frontal lobe signs, and DRS-R98 in the SSD group were intermediate between no delirium and delirium, as well as for the DDT-Pro items (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: All DDT-Pro items, which represent the three delirium core domains, are important for SSD diagnosis. Patients scoring in the SSD 6-7 range have significant clinical and prognostic features and deserve clinical attention.."}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Acute, transient, but sometimes persistent, delirium is characterized by a sharp disruption in attention, consciousness, and cognitive function, and can be caused by many medications and disorders. Delirium occurrence and negative consequences, such as falls and functional decline, can be decreased with multifactorial prevention and timely detection. AIMS: To describe current clinical practice in relation to the prevention, assessment, and management of delirium in Irish hospitals; awareness-raising and educational activities; and barriers to good practice. METHODS: On World Delirium Awareness Day (15th March 2023), a global survey was conducted of delirium prevalence and care. A senior clinical staff member on each participating ward reported on delirium prevalence at 8AM and 8PM, and on usual ward practice; this data was entered into an online survey by a data collector (typically a clinician from the site, visiting several wards to record data). This study reports data from Irish hospitals. RESULTS: In total, 132 wards from 15 hospitals across Ireland participated. Almost 60% of wards used 'personal judgment' for delirium assessment. Having at least one delirium training session in the preceding year was associated with greater use of a formal assessment tool (60.3% versus 18.8%; p < 0.001). Wards reported staff training/education as the main priority to improve care, but 72.7% of wards identified insufficient time to train staff as a key barrier. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practice related to delirium care requires improvement. Awareness raising and staff training require more focus and time in busy clinical settings.."}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delirium is the most common cerebral dysfunction in the intensive care unit (ICU) and can be subdivided into a hypoactive, hyperactive, or mixed motor subtype based on the clinical manifestation. The aim of this review was to describe the distribution, pharmacological interventions, and outcomes of delirium motor subtypes in ICU patients. METHODS: This systematic scoping review was performed according to the PRISMA-ScR and Cochrane guidelines. We performed a systematic search in six major databases to identify relevant studies. A meta-regression analysis was performed where pooled estimates with 95% confidence intervals were computed by a random effect model. RESULTS: We included 131 studies comprising 13,902 delirious patients. There was a large between-study heterogeneity among studies, including differences in study design, setting, population, and outcome reporting. Hypoactive delirium was the most prevalent delirium motor subtype (50.3% [95% CI 46.0-54.7]), followed by mixed delirium (27.7% [95% CI 24.1-31.3]) and hyperactive delirium (22.7% [95% CI 19.0-26.5]). When comparing the delirium motor subtypes, patients with mixed delirium experienced the longest delirium duration, ICU and hospital length of stay, the highest ICU and hospital mortality, and more frequently received administration of specific agents (antipsychotics, alpha2-agonists, benzodiazepines, and propofol) during ICU stay. In studies with high average age for delirious patients (> 65 years), patients were more likely to experience hypoactive delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoactive delirium was the most prevalent motor subtype in critically ill patients. Mixed delirium had the worst outcomes in terms of delirium duration, length of stay, and mortality, and received more pharmacological interventions compared to other delirium motor subtypes. Few studies contributed to secondary outcomes; hence, these results should be interpreted with care. The large between-study heterogeneity suggests that a more standardized methodology in delirium research is warranted..'}}]}

Abstract: An interdisciplinary plenary session entitled "Rethinking and Rehashing Delirium" was held during the 2021 Annual Meeting of the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry to facilitate dialog on the prevalent approach to delirium. Panel members included a psychiatrist, neurointensivist, and critical care specialist, and attendee comments were solicited with the goal of developing a statement. Discussion was focused on a reappraisal of delirium and, in particular, its disparate terminology and history in relation to acute encephalopathy. The authors endorse a recent joint position statement that describes acute encephalopathy as a rapidly evolving (<4 weeks) pathobiological brain process that presents as subsyndromal delirium, delirium, or coma and suggest the following points of refinement: (1) to suggest that "delirium disorder" describe the diagnostic construct including its syndrome, precipitant(s), and unique pathophysiology; (2) to restrict the term "delirium" to describing the clinical syndrome encountered at the bedside; (3) to clarify that the disfavored term "altered mental status" may occasionally be an appropriate preliminary designation where the diagnosis cannot yet be specified further; and (4) to provide rationale for rejecting the terms acute brain injury, failure, or dysfunction. The final common pathway of delirium appears to involve higher-level brain network dysfunction, but there are many insults that can disrupt functional connectivity. We propose that future delirium classification systems should seek to characterize the unique pathophysiological disturbances ("endotypes") that underlie delirium and delirium\'s individual neuropsychiatric symptoms. We provide provisional means of classification in hopes that novel subtypes might lead to specific intervention to improve patient experience and outcomes. This paper concludes by considering future directions for the field. Key areas of opportunity include interdisciplinary initiatives to harmonize efforts across specialties and settings, enhance underrepresented groups in research, integration of delirium and encephalopathy in coding, development of relevant quality and safety measures, and exploration of opportunities for translational science..'}}]}

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: There is a paucity of data on the effect of preinjury substance (alcohol, drugs) abuse on the risk of delirium in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study aimed to assess the incidence of delirium among patients with blunt TBI in association with different substances. METHODS: We analyzed the 2020 American College of Surgeons-Trauma Quality Improvement Program. We included all adult (>=18 y) patients with blunt TBI who had a recorded substance (drugs and alcohol) screening. Our primary outcome was the incidence of delirium. RESULTS: A total of 72,901 blunt TBI patients were identified. The mean (standard deviation) age was 56 (20) years and 68.0% were males. The median (interquartile range) injury severity score was 17 (10-25). Among the study population, 23.1% tested positive for drugs (Stimulants: 3.0%; Depressants: 2.9%, hallucinogens: 5.1%, Cannabinoids: 13.4%, TCAs: 0.1%), and 22.8% tested positive for Alcohol. Overall, 1856 (2.5%) experienced delirium. On univariate analysis, patients who developed delirium were more likely to have positive drug screening results. On multivariable regression analyses, positive screen tests for isolated stimulants (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.340, P = 0.018), tricyclic antidepressants (aOR: 3.107, P = 0.019), and cannabinoids (aOR: 1.326, P <= 0.001) were independently associated with higher odds of developing delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one-fourth of adult patients with blunt TBI had an initial positive substance screening test. Patients with positive results for isolated stimulants, tricyclic antidepressants, and cannabinoids were at a higher risk of developing delirium, whereas this association was not evident with other drugs and alcohol-positive tests. These findings emphasize the need for early drug screening in TBI patients and close monitoring of patients with positive screening tests..'}}]}

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the current status of delirium care self-efficacy among nurses in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the level of their knowledge about delirium in the ICU, more importantly, to analyze factors influencing the delirium care self-efficacy of ICU nurses and to provide a theoretical basis for ICU nursing managers to develop strategies for effective delirium care and management. METHODS: The study was based on a sample of 283 ICU nurses from eight hospitals in Chongqing selected using a convenience sampling method between July 2023 and September 2023. The tools used included a general information questionnaire, the Chinese version of the Delirium Care Self-Efficacy of ICU Nurses Scale, and the Chinese version of the ICU Delirium Knowledge Level Questionnaire. RESULTS: The self-efficacy score (47.84 +- 9.93) of ICU nurses was positively correlated with the delirium knowledge level score (12.32 +- 3.47, r = 0.591, P < 0.001). Multivariate linear regression analysis identified the gender of the nurse, hospital level (tier), duration of ICU work experience, whether the nurse was a specialized ICU nurse, whether the nurse received delirium-related training, and the level of knowledge about delirium (all P < 0.05) as the influencing factors for the delirium care self-efficacy of ICU nurses. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that ICU nursing managers offer targeted interventions based on the influencing factors to improve the delirium care self-efficacy of ICU nurses and their delirium knowledge levels, thereby reducing the incidence of delirium and improving the quality of care provided for patients with delirium in the ICU..'}}]}

Abstract: PURPOSE: To create, validate, and refine an intensive care unit (ICU) delirium education intervention to prepare family members to partner with the ICU care team to detect delirium symptoms and prevent and manage delirium using nonpharmacological strategies. METHODS: In this pre-test post-test quasi-experimental study, consecutive eligible family members of critically ill patients admitted to an ICU completed an ICU Family Education Delirium intervention in two parts: 1) six-minute video on ICU delirium (risk factors, prevention/management, symptoms, communication with the ICU care team), and 2) two case vignettes to practice detecting delirium using family-administered delirium detection questionnaires (Family Confusion Assessment Method [FAM-CAM] and Sour Seven). Family members' delirium knowledge was measured before, immediately after, and two weeks following the intervention using the Caregiver ICU Delirium Knowledge Questionnaire (CIDKQ). RESULTS: Of 99 family members recruited over eight months, 81 (82%) completed the intervention and 63 (63/81, 78%) completed all follow-up questionnaires. Family members' delirium knowledge improved significantly following the intervention (pre-CIDKQ, 14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13 to 15; post-CIDKQ, 17; 95% CI, 16 to 17; P < 0.001) and was retained two weeks after the intervention (CIDKQ 16; 95% CI, 16 to 17; P < 0.001). This included increased knowledge regarding delirium risk factors (e.g., medication, mechanical ventilation), prevention/management (e.g., orientation, day/night routine), and symptoms of delirium. More family members correctly detected delirium symptoms in case vignettes using the Sour Seven (92%) compared with the FAM-CAM (78%). CONCLUSIONS: A video-based ICU delirium education intervention is effective in educating family members about prevention, detection, and management of delirium.."}}]}

Abstract: Over 2.6 million adults over the age of 65 develop delirium each year in the United States (US). Delirium is associated with a significant increase in mortality and the US health care costs associated with delirium are estimated at over $164 billion annually. Despite the prevalence of the condition, the molecular pathophysiology of delirium remains unexplained, limiting the development of pharmacotherapies. Delirious patients can be identified by prominent impairments in attention and working memory (WM), two cognitive domains that localize to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). The dlPFC is also a key site for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, and given the high risk of delirium in AD patients, suggests that efforts at understanding delirium might focus on the dlPFC as a final common endpoint for cognitive changes. Preclinical studies of the dlPFC reproduce many of the pharmacological observations made of delirious patients, including sensitivity to anticholinergics and an 'inverted U' pattern of dependence on monoaminergic input, with diminished performance outside a narrow range of signaling. Medications like guanfacine, which influence the dlPFC in the context of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), have emerged as therapies for delirium and motivate a detailed understanding of the influence of alpha-2 agonists on WM. In this review, I will discuss the neural circuitry and molecular mechanisms underlying WM and the function of the dlPFC. Localizing the cognitive deficits that are commonly seen in delirious patients may help identify new molecular targets for this highly prevalent disease..

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Post-stroke delirium (POD) in patients on stroke units (SU) is associated with an increased risk for complications and poorer clinical outcome. The objective was to reduce the severity of POD by implementing an interprofessional delirium-management. METHODS: Multicentric quality-improvement project on five SU implementing a delirium-management with pre/post-comparison. Primary outcome was severity of POD, assessed with the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC). Secondary outcome parameters were POD incidence, duration, modified Rankin Scale (mRS), length of stay in SU and hospital, mortality, and others. RESULTS: Out of a total of 799 patients, 59.4% (n = 475) could be included with 9.5% (n = 45) being delirious. Implementation of a delirium-management led to reduced POD severity; Nu-DESC median: pre: 3.5 (interquartile range 2.6-4.7) vs. post 3.0 (2.2-4.0), albeit not significant (p = 0.154). Other outcome parameters were not meaningful different. In the post-period, delirium-management could be delivered to 75% (n = 18) of delirious patients, and only 24 (53.3%) of delirious patients required pharmacological treatments. Patients with a more severe stroke and POD remained on their disability levels, compared to similar affected, non-delirious patients who improved. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of delirium-management on SU is feasible and can be delivered to most patients, but with limited effects. Nursing interventions as first choice could be delivered to the majority of patients, and only the half required pharmacological treatments. Delirium-management may lead to reduced severity of POD but had only partial effects on duration of POD or length of stay. POD hampers rehabilitation, especially in patients with more severe stroke.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common geriatric syndrome, but only few studies have been done in nursing home residents. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate (point) prevalence of and risk factors for delirium in nursing homes in Belgium. METHODS: A multisite, cross-sectional study was conducted in six nursing homes in Belgium. Residents of six nursing homes were screened for delirium. Exclusion criteria were coma,\'end-of-life\' status and residing in a dementia ward. Delirium was assessed using the Delirium Observation Screening Scale. RESULTS: 338 of the 448 eligible residents were included in this study. Of the 338 residents who were evaluated, 14.2 % (95 %CI:3.94-4.81) screened positive for delirium with the Delirium Observation Screening Scale. The mean age was 84.7 years and 67.5 % were female. Taking antipsychotics (p = 0.009), having dementia (p = 0.005), pneumonia (p = 0.047) or Parkinson\'s disease (p = 0.03) were more present in residents with delirium. The residents were more frequently physically restrained (p = 0.001), participated less in activities (p = 0.04), had had more often a fall incident (p = 0.007), had lower levels of cognition (p < 0.001; MoCA >= 26, p = 0.04; MoCA >= 25, p = 0.008) and a higher "Activities of Daily Living" score (p = 0.001). In multivariable binary logistic regression analysis, a fall incident (2.76; 95 %CI: 1.24-6.14) and cognitive impairment (OR: 0.69; 95 %CI: 0.63-0.77) were significantly associated with delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is an important clinical problem affecting almost 15 % of the nursing home residents at a given moment. Screening of nursing home residents for risk factors and presence of delirium is important to prevent delirium if possible and to treat underlying causes when present..'}}]}

Abstract: Delirium is a common neurocognitive disorder in hospital settings, characterised by fluctuating impairments in attention and arousal following an acute precipitant. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a useful method to understand delirium pathophysiology. We performed a systematic review to investigate associations between delirium and EEG measures recorded prior, during, and after delirium. A total of 1,655 articles were identified using PsycINFO, Embase and MEDLINE, 31 of which satisfied inclusion criteria. Methodological quality assessment was undertaken, resulting in a mean quality score of 4 out of a maximum of 5. Qualitative synthesis revealed EEG slowing and reduced functional connectivity discriminated between those with and without delirium (i.e. EEG during delirium); the opposite pattern was apparent in children, with cortical hyperexcitability. EEG appears to have utility in differentiating those with and without delirium, but delirium vulnerability and the long-term effects on brain function require further investigation. Findings provide empirical support for the theory that delirium is a disorder of reduced functional brain integration..'}}]}

Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare the effects of prevention interventions on delirium occurrence in critically ill adults. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Prospero, and WHO international clinical trial registry were searched from inception to April 8, 2021. Randomized controlled trials of pharmacological, sedation, non-pharmacological, and multi-component interventions enrolling adult critically ill patients were included. We performed conventional pairwise meta-analyses, NMA within Bayesian random effects modeling, and determined surface under the cumulative ranking curve values and mean rank. Reviewer pairs independently extracted data, assessed bias using Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and evidence certainty with GRADE. The primary outcome was delirium occurrence; secondary outcomes were durations of delirium and mechanical ventilation, length of stay, mortality, and adverse effects. RESULTS: Eighty trials met eligibility criteria: 67.5% pharmacological, 31.3% non-pharmacological and 1.2% mixed pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. For delirium occurrence, 11 pharmacological interventions (38 trials, N = 11,993) connected to the evidence network. Compared to placebo, only dexmedetomidine (21/22 alpha2 agonist trials were dexmedetomidine) probably reduces delirium occurrence (odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% Credible Interval (CrI) 0.21-0.85; moderate certainty). Compared to benzodiazepines, dexmedetomidine (OR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.08-0.51; low certainty), sedation interruption (OR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.06-0.69; very low certainty), opioid plus benzodiazepine (OR 0.27, 95% CrI 0.10-0.76; very low certainty), and protocolized sedation (OR 0.27, 95% CrI 0.09-0.80; very low certainty) may reduce delirium occurrence but the evidence is very uncertain. Dexmedetomidine probably reduces ICU length of stay compared to placebo (Ratio of Means (RoM) 0.78, CrI 0.64-0.95; moderate certainty) and compared to antipsychotics (RoM 0.76, CrI 0.61-0.98; low certainty). Sedative interruption, protocolized sedation and opioids may reduce hospital length of stay compared to placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain. No intervention influenced mechanical ventilation duration, mortality, or arrhythmia. Single and multi-component non-pharmacological interventions did not connect to any evidence networks to allow for ranking and comparisons as planned; pairwise comparisons did not detect differences compared to standard care. CONCLUSION: Compared to placebo and benzodiazepines, we found dexmedetomidine likely reduced the occurrence of delirium in critically ill adults. Compared to benzodiazepines, sedation-minimization strategies may also reduce delirium occurrence, but the evidence is uncertain..'}}]}

Abstract: (1) Introduction: Delirium is a cognitive disorder that affects up to 80% of ICU patients and has many negative consequences. The occurrence of delirium in an ICU patient also negatively affects the relatives caring for these patients. The aim of this study was to explore patients' and their families' experiences of delirium during their ICU stay. (2) Method: The study used a qualitative design based on phenomenology as a research method. A semi-structured interview method was used to achieve the aim. The responses of patients and their families were recorded and transcribed, and the data were coded and analyzed. (3) Results: Eight interviews were conducted with past ICU patients who developed delirium during hospitalization and their family members. The mean age of the participants was 71 years. Of the eight patients, 2 (25%) were female and 6 (75%) were male. The relationships of the 8 carers with the patients were wife (in 4 cases), daughter (in 2 cases), and son (in 2 cases). The average length of time a patient stayed in the ICU was 24 days. The following themes were extracted from the interviews: education, feelings before the delirium, pain, thirst, the day after, talking to the family/patient, and return home. (4) Conclusions: Post-delirium patients and their families feel that more emphasis should be placed on information about delirium. Most patients feel embarrassed and ashamed about events during a delirium episode. Patients fear the reaction of their families when delirium occurs. Patients' families are not concerned about their relatives returning home and believe that the home environment will allow them to forget the delirium events more quickly during hospitalization.."}}]}

Abstract: Background: Delirium is a cognitive disorder that occurs with high frequency in patients in intensive care units and affects patient outcomes. Despite recommendations for monitoring and assessing delirium in the ICU, studies show that it is still not routinely assessed and often remains undiagnosed or misinterpreted as dementia or depression. Aim: The aim of this study was (1) to assess nurses' knowledge and clinical practices regarding delirium, (2) to identify the factors associated with nurses' knowledge, and (3) to define barriers to effective control of delirium. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 371 ICU nurses in Poland. Results: 53.1% of nurses had never been educated on delirium control resulting in a deficit in knowledge of delirium symptoms, risk factors and complications associated with delirium in ICU patients. Master's degree in nursing (vs. Registered nurses + Bachelor's), female gender, and working in university hospital (vs. other) were positively correlated with nurse's knowledge, while age had a negative impact on knowledge. Delirium is a marginalized state in ICU patients, only 16.4% of nurses assessed delirium routinely and 35.8% assessed delirium occasionally, rarely using validated scales. Barriers to effective delirium control were primarily the lack of a requirement to assess delirium, the difficulty of assessing delirium in intubated patients and nurses' lack of confidence in their ability to use delirium assessment tools. Conclusions: There is an urgent need to educate nurses about delirium and to make delirium assessment obligatory in clinical practice. The area of change should also include a hospital policy on delirium monitoring and management. The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05384964).."}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delirium is more prevalent in older people and estimated to occur in up to 50% of the hospital population. Delirium comprises a spectrum of behaviours, including cognitive and attention deficits, and fluctuating levels of consciousness, often associated with an underlying physiological disturbance. Delirium has been increasingly associated with adverse outcomes. Although often preventable or can at least be mitigated, delirium may not be a standard part of assessment and thus may not be recognized in the early stages when it is most likely to be treated successfully. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of knowledge of delirium amongst clinicians caring for patients at high risk of developing delirium and to determine whether education can improve clinical assessment of delirium. METHODS: Two hundred and forty-six case notes were audited before and 149 were reviewed after the education intervention and implementation of a delirium screening tool. Clinicians at the hospital were invited to complete a questionnaire on knowledge of delirium. The questionnaire was based on a validated tool which contained 39 questions about delirium. The questionnaire also contained 28 questions on delirium knowledge. Additional questions were included to gather demographic information specific to the hospital. Descriptive statistics, chi square and independent t-tests were conducted to test for differences in knowledge between the pre and post periods. The Squire Checklist Reporting Guidelines for Quality Improvement Studies informed the preparation of the manuscript. RESULTS: The audit demonstrated that the use of a cognitive assessment tool overall increased from 8.5% in pre education to 43% in the post education period. One hundred and fifty-nine staff completed the questionnaire in total, 118 the pre and 41 post. The knowledge subscale score was high pre and post education and no statistically significant difference was observed. The greatest increase in knowledge was related to knowledge of the risk factors subscale. The increase in knowledge (6.8%) was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: An interprofessional approach to delirium education was effective in not only increasing awareness of the factors associated with this syndrome but also increased the use of a delirium assessment tool..'}}]}

Abstract: For patients hospitalized with COVID-19, delirium is a serious and under-recognized complication, and people experiencing homelessness (PEH) may be at greater risk. This retrospective cohort study compared delirium-associated risk factors and clinical outcomes between PEH and non-PEH. This study used patient records from 154 hospitals discharged from 2020-2021 from the Texas Inpatient Public Use Data file. Study subjects (n = 878) were patients, aged 18-69 years, who were hospitalized with COVID-19 and were identified as homeless. The baseline group included (n = 176,518) patients with COVID-19 aged 18-69 years who were not homeless. Logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for delirium. Relevant risk factors included chronic comorbidities, substance use disorders, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Seven of the delirium-associated risk factors were more prevalent among PEH compared to baseline. PEH had higher rates of TBI, alcohol, cannabis, and opioid use disorders. PEH had significantly higher rates of delirium (10.6% vs. 8.1%; P<0.01). However, PEH had fewer respiratory complications, including pneumonia (48.5% vs. 81.9%; P<0.001) and respiratory failure (28.7% vs. 61.9%; P<0.001), and lower in-hospital mortality (3.3% vs. 9.5%; P<0.001). The anti-viral Remdesivir had a protective effect against delirium (AOR = 0.63; CI: 0.60, 0.66). Mean hospital length of stay (LOS) was more than twice as long for delirious patients compared with non-delirious patients (18.4 days vs. 7.7 days; P<0.001). Delirium greatly increased the risk of in-hospital mortality (AOR = 3.8; CI: 3.6, 4.0). For PEH (n = 29) who died from COVID-19, delirium was present in more than half (52%) of cases. Hospitals should screen PEH for delirium and adopt nursing protocols to prevent delirium and reduce its severity..'}}]}

Abstract: Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome commonly encountered in critically ill patients, and systemic inflammation has been strongly implicated to underlie its pathophysiology. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) for delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU).In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed the clinical and laboratory data of 319 ICU patients from October 2016 to December 2017. Using the Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing technique, a PLR knot was detected at a value of approximately 100. Logistic regression was used to investigate the association between the PLR and delirium.Of the 319 patients included in this study, 29 (9.1%) were diagnosed with delirium. In the delirium group, the duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly longer than that in the no-delirium group (40.2 +- 65.5 vs. 19.9 +- 26.5 hours, respectively; P < .001). A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that PLR > 100 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.003, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.001-1.005), age (OR: 2.76, 95% CI: 1.110-6.861), and the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to the inspired oxygen fraction (OR: 0.996, 95% CI: 0.992-0.999) were independent predictors of delirium.In our study, a high PLR value on ICU admission was associated with a higher incidence of delirium. Owing to easy calculability, the PLR could be a useful delirium predictive index in ICUs, thereby enabling early interventions to be implemented..'}}]}

Abstract: Background: Training programs aiming to improve delirium diagnosis and management skills increase nurses' care efficiency and improve patients' health outcomes. This study was conducted to examine the effect of delirium information training on patient care by intensive care nurses. Methods: In the research, one group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design was used. The study sample consisted of 30 nurses working in four intensive care units of a university hospital between November 05, 2018, and February 15, 2019. The Personal Information Form, the Checklist for the Care of the Patient in Delirium, and the Confusion Assessment Scale for the Intensive Care Unit were used to collect the data. Intensive care nurses were provided with information training supported by a training booklet in two sessions of 40 min each. Results: In the study, according to the Checklist for the Care of the Patient in Delirium, while the pre-test point average of the nurses was 6.17 +- 2.29, the post-test point average had increased to 11.17 +- 1.51 (p < 0.001). After the training, it was determined that there was a significant increase in the percentage of nurses who stated that they evaluated and detected whether their patients had pain, hallucinations, and delusions (p < 0.001). As a result, it has been determined that providing delirium information training to intensive care nurses positively affects the care of patients with delirium. In addition, it has been determined that with the Confusion Assessment Scale for Intensive Care Unit, nurses can provide the care they need to patients at risk in terms of delirium by identifying delirium.."}}]}

Abstract: Delirium, an acute change in cognition, is common, morbid, and costly, particularly among hospitalized older adults. Despite growing knowledge of its epidemiology, far less is known about delirium pathophysiology. Initial work understanding delirium pathogenesis has focused on assaying single or a limited subset of molecules or genetic loci. Recent technological advances at the forefront of biomarker and drug target discovery have facilitated application of multiple "omics" approaches aimed to provide a more complete understanding of complex disease processes such as delirium. At its basic level, "omics" involves comparison of genes (genomics, epigenomics), transcripts (transcriptomics), proteins (proteomics), metabolites (metabolomics), or lipids (lipidomics) in biological fluids or tissues obtained from patients who have a certain condition (i.e., delirium), and those who do not. Multi-omics analyses of these various types of molecules combined with machine learning and systems biology enables the discovery of biomarkers, biological pathways, and predictors of delirium, thus elucidating its pathophysiology. This review provides an overview of the most recent omics techniques, their current impact on identifying delirium biomarkers, and future potential in enhancing our understanding of delirium pathogenesis. We summarize challenges in identification of specific biomarkers of delirium, and more importantly, in discovering the mechanisms underlying delirium pathophysiology. Based on mounting evidence, we highlight a heightened inflammatory response as one common pathway in delirium risk and progression, and we suggest other promising biological mechanisms that have recently emerged. Advanced multiple omics approaches coupled with bioinformatics methodologies have great promise to yield important discoveries that will advance delirium research..'}}]}

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to identify the types and contents of non-pharmacological delirium prevention interventions applied to inpatients in general wards, and to verified the effectiveness of the interventions on the incidence of delirium. We performed an extensive search of bibliographic databases and registries (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, PubMed and Google Scholar, and Korean DB such as RISS, DBpia, KISS, NDSL and KCI) using terms to identify delirium, prevention, and non-pharmacological. We searched all databases from their inception to January 2021 and imposed restriction on language of publication in English and Korean. We included studies if they were conducted as all types of randomized controlled trials (RCT), involving adult patients aged 19 years or more who were admitted to a general ward. We included trials comparing non-pharmacological intervention versus usual care. The entire process of data selection and extraction, assessment of risk of bias with ROB2.O was independently performed by three researchers. The estimated effect size was an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval. The fixed effects model and general inverse variance estimation method were adopted. The type of non-pharmacological delirium prevention interventions for inpatients in general ward was mainly multi-component intervention to correct delirium risk factors. The content and intensity of non-pharmacological interventions varied greatly depending on the characteristics of the patient and the clinical situation. As a result of the meta-analysis, non-pharmacological multi-component intervention was effective in reducing the incidence of delirium, and it was confirmed that it was effective in reducing the incidence of delirium in both the internal and surgical wards. It was confirmed by quantitative evidence that non-pharmacological interventions, especially multi-component interventions, were effective in preventing delirium in general ward inpatients..'}}]}

Abstract: Objectives: The assessment of prevalence of delirium in advanced cancer patients admitted in hospice centre and outcome after palliative intervention. The possible related risk factors for development of delirium. Material and Methods: This was prospective analytic study done at hospice centre attached with tertiary cancer hospital in Ahmedabad during August 2019 - July 2021. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Committee. We selected patients according to following inclusion criteria (all patient admitted to hospice centre above 18 years, with advance cancer disease and on best supportive care) and exclusion criteria (Lack of informed consent, Inability to participate in study due to mentally retard or coma). The following information were collected: age, gender, address, type of cancer, comorbidities, history of substance abuse, history of (h/o) palliative chemotherapy or radiotherapy within last 3month, general condition, ESAS (Edmonton symptom assessment scale), ECOG (Eastern cooperative oncology group), PaP score (palliative prognostic score), medication including opioids, NSAIDs (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), steroids, antibiotic, adjuvant analgesic, PPI (Proton pump inhibitor), anti-emetic etc. Delirium diagnosis was based on diagnostic criterion of DSM-IV text revised and MDAS. Results: In our study we found prevalence of delirium was 31.29% in advanced cancer patients admitted to hospice centre. We found most common type of delirium is hypoactive (34.7%) and mixed subtype (34.7%) followed by hyperactive (30.4%) delirium. Resolution of delirium was higher among hyperactive delirium (78.57%) followed by mixed subtype (50%) and hypoactive (12.5%). Mortality was higher among patient with hypoactive subtype (81.25%) followed by mixed (43.75%) and hyperactive delirium (14.28%). Conclusion: An identification and assessment of delirium is vital for acceptable end of life care within the palliative care in light of the fact that the presence of delirium is related with morbidity, mortality, prolonged ICU hospitalization, expanded time on a ventilator, and by and large more prominent medical services costs. Clinicians should utilize one of a few approved delirium assessment tools to help evaluate and archive cognitive function. Prevention and recognizing the clinical reason for delirium are generally the best method for diminishing the morbidity from delirium. The study results demonstrate that multi component delirium management or projects are generally proficient to lessen the prevalence and negative outcomes of delirium. It was found that palliative care intervention has quite a positive outcome as it not only focus on the mental health of the patients but also of family members who go through the same amount of distress and also help them to communicate properly and manage to settle the mental state and end the life without pain and distress..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: COPD combined with respiratory failure is very common in intensive care unit (ICU). We aimed to evaluate the current status and influencing factors of delirium in elderly COPD patients with undergoing mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Patients with COPD combined with respiratory failure and mechanically ventilated who were admitted to the ICU of our hospital were selected. The characteristics of included patients were assessed. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the characteristics of patients and delirium. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the risk factors of delirium in elderly patients with COPD combined with respiratory failure undergoing mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 237 COPD combined with respiratory failure patients were included, the incidence of delirium was 21.94%. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that age (r = 0.784), BMI (r = 0.709), hypertension (r = 0.696), APACHE II score (r = 0.801), CPOT (r = 0.513), sedation(r = 0.626) and PaO2 (r = 0.611) were all correlated with the occurrence of delirium (all p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis indicated that age >= 75y (OR 3.112, 95% CI 2.144-4.602), BMI <= 19 kg/m2 (OR 2.742, 95% CI 1.801-3.355), hypertension(OR 1.909, 95% CI 1.415-2.421), APACHE II score >= 15 (OR 2.087, 95% CI 1.724-2.615), CPOT >= 5 (OR 1.778, 95% CI 1.206-2.641), sedation(OR 3.147, 95% CI 2.714-3.758), PaO2 <= 75 mmHg(OR 2.196, 95%CI 1.875-3.088) were the risk factors of delirium in elderly patients with COPD combined with respiratory failure undergoing mechanical ventilation (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is common in patients with COPD and respiratory failure undergoing mechanical ventilation, and there are many related influencing factors. Medical staff should pay more attention to patients with risk factors and take intervention measures as soon as possible to reduce the incidence of delirium..'}}]}

Abstract: Background: Delirium is a reversible state that, if ignored, can result in increased morbidity and mortality. Studies from across the world have shown that nurses' knowledge regarding delirium is inadequate. This study is one of the very few Indian studies addressing this issue. The study aims to infer an intensive care unit (ICU) nurse's knowledge regarding delirium. Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive study carried out in the ICUs of a multispecialty general hospital. A convenient sample of 220 nurses was recruited after obtaining written informed consent. Knowledge regarding delirium was ascertained using the Delirium Knowledge Questionnaire; this, along with the sociodemographic variables, was circulated as Google Forms through WhatsApp groups. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26, and results were presented as means and percentages. Results: The present study reveals that out of 211 nurses 130 (61.6%) had an average knowledge about delirium. Out of the 211 nurses 108 (51.2%) had average knowledge about clinical features of delirium and 105(49.8%) had average knowledge about etiology of delirium. More than half of the nurses (53.1%) had awareness regarding the medical management of delirium. In the domain of knowledge regarding non-medical management, 81 (38.4%) had excellent knowledge and 114 (54%) respondents had average knowledge regarding the prevention of delirium. Conclusion: The study calls for the need to provide educational interventions to the nursing staff for prevention, prompt recognition, and treatment of delirium.."}}]}

Abstract: Delirium- an acute disorder of attention and cognition- is the commonest complication following hip fracture. Patients with hip fracture are particularly vulnerable to delirium, and many of the lessons from the care of the patient with hip fracture will extend to other surgical cohorts. Prevention and management of delirium for patients presenting with hip fracture, extending along a continuum from arrival through to the post-operative setting. Best practice guidelines emphasize multidisciplinary care including management by an orthogeriatric service, regular delirium screening, and multimodal interventions. The evidence base for prevention is strongest in terms of multifaceted interventions, while once delirium has set in, early recognition and identification of the cause are key. Integration of effective strategies is often suboptimal, and may be supported by approaches such as interactive teaching methodologies, routine feedback, and clear protocol dissemination. Partnering with patients and carers will support person centered care, improve patient experiences, and may improve outcomes. Ongoing work needs to focus on implementing recognized best practice, in order to minimize the health, social and economic costs of delirium..'}}]}

Abstract: Background: In an ever-aging society, health care systems will be confronted with an increasing number of patients over 80 years ("the very old"). Currently, knowledge about and recommendations for delirium management are often based on studies in patients aged 60 to 65 years. It is not clear whether these findings apply to patients >=80 years. Aim: Comparison of younger and older patients with delirium, especially regarding risk factors. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, within 1-year, 5,831 patients (18-80 years: n = 4,730; >=80: n = 1,101) with delirium were enrolled. The diagnosis of delirium was based on the Delirium Observation screening scale (DOS), Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) and a DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual)-5 construct of nursing instrument. Sociodemographic trajectories, as well as the relevant predisposing and precipitating factors for delirium, were assessed via a multiple regression analysis. Results: The very old were more commonly admitted as emergencies (OR 1.42), had a greater mortality risk (OR 1.56) and displayed fewer precipitating risk factors for the development of a delirium, although the number of diagnoses were not different (p = 0.325). Predisposing factors were sufficient almost alone for the development of delirium in patients >= 80 years of age; in 18-80 years of age, additional precipitating factors had to occur to make a delirium possible. Conclusion: When relevant predisposing factors for delirium are apparent, patients over 80 years of age require comparatively few or no precipitating factors to develop delirium. This finding should be taken into account at hospitalization and may allow better treatment of delirium in the future..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: While delirium prevalence and duration are each associated with increased 30-day, 6-month, and 1-year mortality, the association between incident ICU delirium and mortality remains unclear. We evaluated the association between both incident ICU delirium and days spent with delirium in the 28 days after ICU admission and mortality within 28 and 90 days. METHODS: Secondary cohort analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 1495 delirium-free, critically ill adults in 14 Dutch ICUs with an expected ICU stay >=2 days where all delirium assessments were completed. In the 28 days after ICU admission, patients were evaluated for delirium and coma 3x daily; each day was coded as a delirium day [>=1 positive Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU)], a coma day [no delirium and >= 1 Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) score <= - 4], or neither. Four Cox-regression models were constructed for 28-day mortality and 90-day mortality; each accounted for potential confounders (i.e., age, APACHE-II score, sepsis, use of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, and haloperidol dose) and: 1) delirium occurrence, 2) days spent with delirium, 3) days spent in coma, and 4) days spent with delirium and/or coma. RESULTS: Among the 1495 patients, 28 day mortality was 17% and 90 day mortality was 21%. Neither incident delirium (28 day mortality hazard ratio [HR] = 1.02, 95%CI = 0.75-1.39; 90 day mortality HR = 1.05, 95%CI = 0.79-1.38) nor days spent with delirium (28 day mortality HR = 1.00, 95%CI = 0.95-1.05; 90 day mortality HR = 1.02, 95%CI = 0.98-1.07) were significantly associated with mortality. However, both days spent with coma (28 day mortality HR = 1.05, 95%CI = 1.02-1.08; 90 day mortality HR = 1.05, 95%CI = 1.02-1.08) and days spent with delirium or coma (28 day mortality HR = 1.03, 95%CI = 1.00-1.05; 90 day mortality HR = 1.03, 95%CI = 1.01-1.06) were significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests neither incident delirium nor days spent with delirium are associated with short-term mortality after ICU admission.

Abstract: ABSTRACT: Postoperative delirium is a serious complication that relates to poor outcomes. A risk prediction model could help the staff screen for children at high risk for postoperative delirium. Our study aimed to establish a postoperative delirium prediction model for pediatric patients and to verify the sensitivity and specificity of this model.Data were collected from a total of 1134 children (0-16yr) after major elective surgery between February 2020 to June 2020. Demographic and clinical data were collected to explore the risk factors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to develop the model, and we assessed the predictive ability of the model by using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC). Further data were collected from another 100 patients in October 2020 to validate the model.Prevalence of postoperative delirium in this sample was 11.1%. The model consisted of 5 predictors, namely, age, developmental delay, type of surgery, pain, and dexmedetomidine. The AUROC was 0.889 (P < .001, 95% confidence interval (CI):0.857-0.921), with sensitivity and specificity of 0.754 and 0.867, and the Youden of 0.621. The model verification results showed the sensitivity of 0.667, the specificity of 0.955.Children undergoing surgery are at risk for developing delirium during the postoperative period, young age, developmental delay, otorhinolaryngology surgery, pain, and exposure to dexmedetomidine were associated with increased odds of delirium. Our study established a postoperative delirium prediction model for pediatric patients, which may be a base for development of strategies to prevent and treat postoperative delirium in children..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delirium is an acute brain dysfunction associated with an increased risk of mortality and future dementia. OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence of clinically documented delirium in the United States on World Delirium Awareness Day 2023. METHODS: This is a sub-analysis of a prospective, cross-sectional, online, international survey. All health care settings were eligible, with the exception of operating rooms and outpatient clinics. Health care clinicians, administrators, and researchers completed the survey. The primary outcome was the prevalence of clinically documented delirium at 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. on March 15, 2023. Secondary outcomes were related to health care delivery. Descriptive statistics are reported. Differences between unit types (non-intensive care unit vs intensive care unit) were examined for all outcomes. RESULTS: Ninety-one hospital units reported on 1318/1213 patients. The prevalence of clinically documented delirium was 16.4% (n = 216/1318) at 8:00 a.m. and 17.9% (n = 217/1213) at 8:00 p.m. (P = 0.316) and significantly differed between age groups, reported discipline, unit, and hospital types. Significant differences were identified between non-intensive care unit and intensive care unit settings in the use of delirium-related protocols, nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management, educational processes, and barriers to evidence-based delirium care. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiologic survey of clinically documented delirium across two time points in the United States. Delirium remains a significant burden and challenge for health care systems. The high percentage of units using delirium management protocols suggests administrator and clinician awareness of evidence-based strategies for its detection and mitigation. We provide recommendations for future studies and quality improvement projects to improve clinical recognition and management of delirium..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common disorder affecting patients' psychiatric illness, characterized by a high rate of underdiagnosis, misdiagnosis, and high risks. However, previous studies frequently excluded patients with psychiatric illness, leading to limited knowledge about risk factors and optimal assessment tools for delirium in psychiatric settings. OBJECTIVES: The scoping review was carried out to (1) identify the risk factors associated with delirium in patients with psychiatric illness; (2) synthesize the performance of assessment tools for detecting delirium in patients with psychiatric illness in psychiatric settings. DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were searched to identify primary studies on delirium in psychiatric settings from inception to Dec 2023 inclusive. Two independent reviewers screened eligible studies against inclusion criteria. A narrative synthesis of the included studies was conducted. RESULTS: A final set of 36 articles meeting the inclusion criteria, two main themes were extracted: risk factors associated with delirium in patients with psychiatric illness and assessment tools for detecting delirium in psychiatric settings. The risk factors associated with delirium primarily included advanced age, physical comorbid, types of psychiatric illness, antipsychotics, anticholinergic drug, Electroconvulsive therapy, and the combination of lithium and Electroconvulsive therapy. Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98, Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, and Delirium Diagnostic Tool-Provisional might be valuable for delirium assessment in patients with psychiatric illness in psychiatric settings. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium diagnosis in psychiatric settings is complex due to the overlapping clinical manifestations between psychiatric illness and delirium, as well as their potential co-occurrence. It is imperative to understand the risk factors and assessment methods related to delirium in this population to address diagnostic delays, establish effective prevention and screening strategies. Future research should focus on designing, implementing, and evaluating interventions that target modifiable risk factors, to prevent and manage delirium in patients with psychiatric illness.."}}]}

The research questions of the study are as follows: "How do community care nurses\' experience delirium?" and "How is delirium identified?". DESIGN: This study has been designed as an explorative and descriptive study. METHODS: A topic-based interview guide was developed containing questions associated with the Registered Nurses\' experiences of their meetings with people with delirium and their identification of delirium. RESULTS: Nurses working in the community care need to know more about delirium as they play a key role in treatment. Our results also show that the participants have difficulty in establishing whether a patient is suffering from acute confusion/delirium, depression or dementia..'}}]}

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate whether there is a causal relationship between educational attainment and delirium at the genetic level using the Mendelian randomization method, and provide new evidence for studies in this field. We found a causal relationship between educational attainment and delirium at the genetic level after excluding confounders using Mendelian randomization. The inverse variance weighting method of random effects was the main analysis method. The weighted median and Mendelian Randomization-Egger methods, as well as simple, and weighted modes were used as supplementary analysis methods. Additionally, horizontal pleiotropy tests were conducted, including the Mendelian Randomization-Egger intercept test and Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier. Cochran\'s Q statistic was used to assess the size of heterogeneity. We retrieved all second single nucleotide polymorphism features and performed multivariate Mendelian randomization to adjust for the effect of potential confounders on our results. The inverse variance weighting suggested a negative correlation between genetically predicted educational attainment and delirium (0.67[0.49-0.92], p = 0.013); Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (0.67[0.49-0.92], p = 0.013) and multivariate Mendelian randomization (0.52[0.33-0.82], p = 0.005) results were generally consistent with the inverse variance weighting method. The Mendelian Randomization-Egger, simple, and weighted mode results were consistent with the inverse variance weighting results. Our results were not affected by pleiotropy or heterogeneity (p > 0.05, for both pleiotropy and heterogeneity). In addition, the "leave-one-out" analysis showed that the results of our Mendelian randomization analysis were not influenced by individual single nucleotide polymorphisms. Studies have found a causal relationship between educational attainment and delirium at the genetic level; higher educational attainment may be a protective factor against delirium. Clinically, more attention should be paid to patients at a high risk of delirium with low educational attainment..'}}]}

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: People with Parkinson disease (PD) may be at increased risk of delirium and associated adverse outcomes. Delirium is an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome defined by confusion and inattention and is common in older adults. Previous studies may have underestimated the prevalence of delirium in PD because of overlapping symptoms, lack of awareness, and poorly defined criteria. We aimed to identify the prevalence and incidence of delirium in inpatients with PD. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were inpatients with PD admitted over a 4-month period. Delirium prevalence was classified using a standardised assessment at a single visit on the basis of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-5) criteria. To capture remaining time in hospital, incident delirium was diagnosed using detailed clinical vignettes and a validated consensus method. RESULTS: Forty-four PD patients consented to take part in the study, accounting for 53 admissions. Delirium prevalence was 34.0% (n = 18); reviewing participants over the duration of their hospital stay identified 30 (56.6%) incident delirium cases. The admitting team screened 24.5% for delirium, and delirium was documented in eight (14.8%) patients' medical notes. Patients with delirium were significantly older, had higher frailty scores, and had a longer hospital stay (P < .05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is common in PD inpatients at admission and incidence increases during hospital stay, but delirium is commonly missed. Our results highlight the importance of screening for delirium throughout patients' stay in hospital. Future studies should consider frequent evaluation over the duration of hospital stay to identify emergent delirium during the admission.."}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of emergence delirium remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between emergence delirium and postoperative delirium in elderly after general anesthesia and surgery. METHODS: This prospective observational study was done in a tertiary hospital in Beijing, China. Elderly patients (65-90 years) who underwent major noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia and admitted to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) after surgery were enrolled. Emergence delirium was assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit during PACU stay. Postoperative delirium was assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method during the first 5 postoperative days. The association between emergence delirium and postoperative delirium was analyzed with a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 942 patients were enrolled and 915 completed the study. Emergence delirium developed in 37.0% (339/915) of patients during PACU stay; and postoperative delirium developed in 11.4% (104/915) of patients within the first 5 postoperative days. After adjusted confounding factors, the occurrence of emergence delirium is independently associated with an increased risk of postoperative delirium (OR 1.717, 95% CI 1.078-2.735, P = 0.023). Patients with emergence delirium stayed longer in PACU and hospital after surgery, and developed more non-delirium complications within 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Emergence delirium in elderly admitted to the PACU after general anesthesia and major surgery is independently associated with an increased risk of postoperative delirium. Patients with emergence delirium had worse perioperative outcomes. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (chictr.org.cn) ChiCTR-OOC-17012734..'}}]}

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Delirium is most often reported as present or absent. Patients with symptoms falling short of the diagnostic criteria for delirium fall into 'no delirium' or 'control' groups. This binary classification neglects individual symptoms and may be hindering identification of the pathophysiology underlying delirium. This systematic review investigates which individual symptoms of delirium are reported by studies of postoperative delirium in adults. METHODS: Medline, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were searched on 03 June 2021 and 06 April 2023. Two reviewers independently examined titles and abstracts. Each paper was screened in duplicate and conflicting decisions settled by consensus discussion. Data were extracted, qualitatively synthesised and narratively reported. All included studies were quality assessed. RESULTS: These searches yielded 4,367 results. After title and abstract screening, 694 full-text studies were reviewed, and 62 deemed eligible for inclusion. This review details 11,377 patients including 2,049 patients with delirium. In total, 78 differently described delirium symptoms were reported. The most reported symptoms were inattention (N = 29), disorientation (N = 27), psychomotor agitation/retardation (N = 22), hallucination (N = 22) and memory impairment (N = 18). Notably, psychomotor agitation and hallucinations are not listed in the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-5-Text Revision delirium definition. CONCLUSIONS: The 78 symptoms reported in this systematic review cover domains of attention, awareness, disorientation and other cognitive changes. There is a lack of standardisation of terms, and many recorded symptoms are synonyms of each other. This systematic review provides a library of individual delirium symptoms, which may be used to inform future reporting.."}}]}

Abstract: Background: Delirium is a neuropsychiatric illness. It affects critically ill patients on ventilator and increases mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of C-reactive protein (CRP) level with delirium in critically obstetrics women and its role in prediction of delirium. Materials and methods: Arospective observational study was conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU), and the duration of study was one year. Total 145 subjects were recruited, 33 patients were excluded, and 112 subjects were studied. For study, group A (n = 36) includes critically ill obstetric women who had delirium on admission; group B (n = 37) includes critically ill obstetric women who developed delirium within 7 days; and group C (n = 39) that includes critically ill obstetric women who did not develop delirium after follow-up of 7 days was served as control. Disease severity was assessed by using acute physiologic assessment and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score, and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) was used to assess awakeness. In awake patients (RASS of >=3), delirium was assessed by the use of confusion assessment method for ICU tools. C-reactive protein measured by particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay-two point kinetic method. Results: The mean ages of group A, B, and C were 26.44 +- 4.72, 27.46 +- 4.97, and 28.26 +- 5.67 years, respectively. C-reactive protein levels on the day of delirium development (group B) were found to be significantly higher than day 1 CRP levels of groups A and C. The mean Global Attentiveness Rating (GAR) was significantly lower in groups A and B as compared to that in group C (p < 0.001). On evaluating the correlation of CRP with GAR, it was found to be inverse and mild in strength for the correlation between CRP and GAR (r = -0.403, p < 0.001). At a cut-off value of >181 mg/L, CRP had sensitivity of 93.2% and specificity of 69.2%. The positive predictive value was 85% and the negative predictive value was 84.4% that differentiate delirium from non-delirium. Conclusion: C-reactive protein is a useful tool for screening and prediction of delirium in critically ill obstetric patients. How to cite this article: Shyam R, Patel ML, Solanki M, Sachan R, Ali W.

Abstract: Delirium is a serious consequence of many acute or worsening chronic medical conditions, a side effect of medications, and a precipitant of worsening functional and cognitive status in older adults. It is a syndrome characterized by fluctuations in cognition and impaired attention that develops over a short period of time in response to an underlying medical condition, a substance (prescribed, over the counter, or recreational), or substance withdrawal and can be multi-factorial. We present a narrative review of the literature on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to prevention and treatment of delirium with a focus on older adults as a vulnerable population. Older adult patients are most at risk due to decreasing physiologic reserves, with delirium rates of up to 80% in critical care settings. Presentation of delirium can be hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed, making identification and study challenging as patients with hypoactive delirium are less likely to come to attention in an inpatient or long-term care setting. Studies of delirium focus on prevention and treatment with nonpharmacological or medication interventions, with the preponderance of evidence favoring multi-component nonpharmacological approaches to prevention as the most effective. Though use of antipsychotic medication in delirium is common, existing evidence does not support routine use, showing no clear benefit in clinically significant outcome measures and with evidence of harm in some studies. We therefore suggest that antipsychotics be used to treat agitation, psychosis, and distress associated with delirium at the lowest effective doses and shortest possible duration and not be considered a treatment of delirium itself. Future studies may clarify the use of other agents, such as melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, alpha-2 receptor agonists, and anti-epileptics..'}}]}

Abstract: Delirium is a severe neuropsychiatric illness that occurs frequently in intensive care and postoperative units which results in prolonged hospital stays and increases patient's mortality and morbidity rates. This review focused on accumulating the common key proteomic signatures significantly associated with delirium. We carried out a systematic literature review of studies on delirium proteomic biomarkers published between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2023 from the following electronic bibliographic databases including PubMed, Scopus, and EBSCOhost (CINAHL, Medline). A total of 1746 studies were identified and reviewed, and 78 studies were included in our review. The PRISMA guidelines, the PEO framework, and JBI quality assessment method were followed in this review to maintain the inclusion and exclusion criteria and risk of bias assessment. Most of the included studies were of the cohort (68%) and case-control (23%) design. We have accumulated a total of 313 proteins or gene encoded proteins of which 189 were unique. Among the unique proteins, we focused on the top 13 most investigated proteins (IL-6, CRP, IL-8, S100B, IL-10, TNF-a, IL-1b, Cortisol, MCP-1, GFAP, IGF-1, IL-1ra, and NFL) that are significantly associated with delirium. Most of these are cytokines and inflammatory proteins indicating a strong interconnection with delirium. There was remarkable inconsistency among the studies in reporting the specific potential proteomic biomarker. No single proteomic biomarker can be solely used to diagnose and predict delirium. The current review provides a rationale for further molecular investigation of delirium-related proteomic biomarkers. Also, it's recommended to conduct further in-depth molecular research to decipher drug target biomolecules for potential prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic development against delirium.."}}]}

Abstract: Delirium occurring in a patient with preexisting dementia is referred to as delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD). DSD commonly occurs in older hospitalized patients and is associated with worse outcomes, including higher rates of mortality and institutionalization, compared to inpatients with delirium or dementia alone. This narrative review summarizes the screening, diagnosis, management, and pathophysiology of DSD and concludes by highlighting opportunities for future research. Studies were identified via Medline and PsycINFO keyword search, and handsearching reference lists. Conceptually, DSD could be considered an "acute exacerbation" of dementia precipitated by a noxious insult akin to an acute exacerbation of heart failure or acute on chronic renal failure. However, unlike other organ systems, there are no established biomarkers for delirium, so DSD is diagnosed and monitored clinically. Because cognitive dysfunction is common to both delirium and dementia, the diagnosis of DSD can be challenging. Inattention, altered levels of arousal, and motor dysfunction may help distinguish DSD from dementia alone. An informant history suggestive of an acute change in cognition or alertness should be investigated and managed as delirium until proven otherwise. The key management principles include prevention, identifying and treating the underlying precipitant(s), implementing multicomponent interventions to create an ideal environment for brain recovery, preventing complications, managing distress, and monitoring for resolution. Informing and involving family members or caregivers throughout the patient journey are essential because there is significant prognostic uncertainty, including the risk of persistent cognitive and functional decline following DSD and relapse. Furthermore, informal carers can provide significant assistance in management. Emerging evidence demonstrates that increased exposure to delirium is associated with neuronal injury and worse cognitive outcomes although the mechanisms through which this occurs remain unclear. Given the clinical overlap between delirium and dementia, studying shared pathophysiological pathways may uncover diagnostic tests and is an essential step in therapeutic innovation..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delirium is characterized by fluctuating attention or arousal, with high prevalence in the orthopaedic ward. Our aim was to: 1) establish the prevalence of delirium on an orthopaedic ward, and 2) compare delirium prevalence using a single geriatrician assessment vs. multiple 3D-CAM (3-Minute Diagnostic Interview for Confusion Assessment Method) assessments during the day. We hypothesized that multiple assessments would increase the detection rate due to the fluctuating nature of delirium. METHODS: Comparative study conducted at an academic hospital in Hamilton, Ontario. Participants included patients 65 years and older admitted to the orthopaedic ward (n=55). After a geriatrician made the first assessment of delirium by 3D-CAM on each patient, teams with specialized geriatrics training re-assessed participants up to four times. Delirium rates based on first assessment were compared to cumulative end-of-day rates to determine if detection increased with multiple assessments. RESULTS: The prevalence of delirium was 30.9% (17 participants) using multiple assessments. Of these cases, 13 (76.4%) were detected in the initial geriatrician assessment. In patients with hip fractures, 70.6% (12 of 17) were identified as delirious by multiple assessments. CONCLUSION: As symptoms fluctuate, multiple daily CAM assessments may increase the identification of delirium in orthopaedic inpatients..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Acute hospitalisation and delirium have individually been shown to adversely affect trajectories of cognitive decline but have not previously been considered together. This work aimed to explore the impact on cognition of hospital admission with and without delirium, compared to a control group with no hospital admissions. METHODS: The Delirium and Cognitive Impact in Dementia (DECIDE) study was nested within the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study II (CFAS II)-Newcastle cohort. CFAS II participants completed two baseline interviews, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). During 2016, surviving participants from CFAS II-Newcastle were recruited to DECIDE on admission to hospital. Participants were reviewed daily to determine delirium status.During 2017, all DECIDE participants and age, sex and years of education matched controls without hospital admissions during 2016 were invited to repeat the CFAS II interview. Delirium was excluded in the control group using the Informant Assessment of Geriatric Delirium Scale (i-AGeD). Linear mixed effects modelling determined predictors of cognitive decline. RESULTS: During 2016, 82 of 205 (40%) DECIDE participants had at least one episode of delirium. At 1 year, 135 of 205 hospitalised participants completed an interview along with 100 controls. No controls experienced delirium (i-AGeD>4). Delirium was associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline compared to those without delirium (beta = -2.2, P < 0.001), but number of hospital admissions was not (P = 0.447). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that delirium during hospitalisation rather than hospitalisation per se is a risk factor for future cognitive decline, emphasising the need for dementia prevention studies that focus on delirium intervention..'}}]}

Abstract: Background: Delirium is a severe neuropsychiatric symptom following acute ischemic stroke (IS) and is associated with poor outcomes. Systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation are believed to contribute to the pathophysiology of delirium. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) are widely recognized as convenient and reliable biomarkers of systemic inflammation. However, their association with delirium after IS remains unclear. Methods: In this study, we identified IS patients requiring ICU admission from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. We employed multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic splines (RCS) to assess the association between the NLR, PLR, and LMR and delirium. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to further explore their causal relationship at the genetic level. Results: A total of 1,436 patients with IS were included in this study, of whom 214 (14.9%) had delirium. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjustment for confounders, the patients in the highest quartile of the NLR (odds ratio [OR] 2.080, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.282-3.375) and LMR (OR 0.503, 95% CI 0.317-0.798) and the patients in the second quartile of the PLR (OR 1.574, 95% CI 1.019-2.431) were significantly associated with delirium. The RCS function showed a progressive increase in the risk of delirium with higher NLR and PLR and lower LMR. In the MR analysis, only the PLR was negatively associated with the risk of delirium. Conclusion: The observational studies found significant associations between the NLR, PLR, and LMR and delirium. However, the MR analysis only demonstrated a potential protective causal relationship between the PLR and delirium. Further prospective studies are needed to validate their association and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms..

Abstract: Delirium and dementia are two frequent causes of cognitive impairment among older adults and have a distinct, complex and interconnected relationship. Delirium is an acute confusional state characterized by inattention, cognitive dysfunction and an altered level of consciousness, whereas dementia is an insidious, chronic and progressive loss of a previously acquired cognitive ability. People with dementia have a higher risk of developing delirium than the general population, and the occurrence of delirium is an independent risk factor for subsequent development of dementia. Furthermore, delirium in individuals with dementia can accelerate the trajectory of the underlying cognitive decline. Delirium prevention strategies can reduce the incidence of delirium and associated adverse outcomes, including falls and functional decline. Therefore, delirium might represent a modifiable risk factor for dementia, and interventions that prevent or minimize delirium might also reduce or prevent long-term cognitive impairment. Additionally, understanding the pathophysiology of delirium and the connection between delirium and dementia might ultimately lead to additional treatments for both conditions. In this Review, we explore mechanisms that might be common to both delirium and dementia by reviewing evidence on shared biomarkers, and we discuss the importance of delirium recognition and prevention in people with dementia..'}}]}

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Delirium is a common postoperative complication of hip fracture. Various methods exist to detect delirium as a reference standard. The goal of this study was to characterize the properties of the measures obtained in a randomized controlled trial, to document their relationship to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders:Text Revision based diagnosis of postoperative delirium by a consensus panel, and to describe the method in detail to allow replication by others. METHODS: A secondary analysis of the randomized trial STRIDE (A Strategy to Reduce the Incidence of Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients) was conducted. Delirium assessments were performed in 200 consecutive hip fracture repair patients >=65 years old. Assessors underwent extensive training in delirium assessment and the final delirium diagnosis was adjudicated by a consensus panel of three physicians with expertise in delirium assessment. RESULTS: A total of 680 consensus panel delirium diagnoses were completed. There were only 19 (2.8%, 19/678) evaluations where the delirium adjudication by the consensus panel differed from delirium findings by the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). In 16 (84%, 16/19) of the cases, CAM was negative but the consensus panel diagnosed the patient as having delirium based on all of the available information including the CAM. CONCLUSION: The consensus panel diagnosis was more sensitive compared to CAM alone, however the magnitude of the difference was not large. When assessors are well trained and delirium assessments are closely supervised throughout the study, CAM may be adequate for delirium diagnosis in a clinical trial. Future studies are needed to test this hypothesis..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on clinical phenotype for delirium that occurs frequently among patients admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical pictures of delirium, and their association with clinical outcomes in CICU patients. METHODS: A total of 4,261 patients who were admitted to the CICU between September 1 2012 to December 31 2018 were retrospectively registered. Patients were excluded if they were admitted to the CICU for less than 24 hours or had missed data. Ultimately, 2,783 patients were included in the analysis. A day of delirium was defined as any day during which at least one CAM-ICU assessment was positive. The clinical risk factors of delirium were classified by the delirium phenotype, as follows; hypoxic, septic, sedative-associated, and metabolic delirium. RESULTS: The incidence of delirium was 24.4% at the index hospitalization in all CICU patients, and 22.6% within 7 days after CICU admission. The most common delirium phenotype was septic delirium (17.2%), followed by hypoxic delirium (16.8%). Multiple phenotypes were observed during most delirium days. Delirium most frequently occurred in patients with heart failure. Of all patients affected by delirium within 7 days, both ICU and hospital mortality significantly increased according to the combined number of delirium phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium occurred in a quarter of patients admitted to the modern CICU and was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Therefore, more efforts are needed to reduce the clinical risk factors of delirium, and to prevent it in order to improve clinical outcomes in the CICU..'}}]}

Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine the correlation and discriminative value of the E-PRE-DELIRIC and PRE-DELIRIC scores with delirium exposure to evaluate the prognostic value of both models. METHODS: A secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial enrolling 1506 delirium-free, critically ill adults with an anticipated ICU stay of >=2 days. Days spent with delirium (>=1 positive CAM-ICU) or coma (>=1 RASS <=-4) in the 28-days after ICU admission were calculated. Patients were categorized into four groups: no delirium, short-exposure (1 delirium day), moderate-exposure (2-5 delirium days), and long- exposure (>=6 delirium days) to determine the correlation and discriminative value of the E-PRE-DELIRIC and the PRE-DELIRIC with days spent with delirium. RESULTS: The correlation between the overall E-PRE-DELIRIC and PRE-DELIRIC scores and days spent with delirium were: R = 0.08 (P = .005) and R = 0.26 (P < .001), respectively. The correlation between both prediction scores and days spent with coma or delirium were R = 0.21 (P < .0001) and R = 0.46 (P < .0001), respectively. The highest Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic for both E-PRE-DELIRIC [0.57 (95% CI:0.51-0.62)] and PRE-DELIRIC [0.58 (95% CI:0.53-0.62)] was found in the long delirium exposure group. CONCLUSION: The E-PRE-DELIRIC and PRE-DELIRIC model each poorly correlate and discriminate with days spent with delirium in the 28 days after ICU admission..'}}]}

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Children with prolonged hospital admissions for CHD often develop delirium. Antipsychotic medications (APMs) have been used to treat delirium but are known to prolong the QTc duration. There is concern for prolongation of the QTc interval in cardiac patients who may be more vulnerable to electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and may have postoperative QTc prolongation already. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of APM on QTc duration in postoperative paediatric cardiac patients and determine the effect of quetiapine and risperidone in treating delirium and QTc prolongation. DESIGN: Retrospective study, July 1, 2017-May 31, 2022. SETTING: Tertiary children's hospital. PATIENTS: Included were patients admitted to the paediatric cardiac ICU at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: ECGs, delirium scores, and drug information were collected. Delirium was defined as Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD) score >9. Mixed effect models were performed to evaluate the effect of surgery on QTc change and the effect of antipsychotics on QTc and CAPD changes. There were 139 children, 55% male and 67% surgical admissions. Median age was 5.9 months. Mean QTc increased after cardiac surgery by 18 ms (p = 0.014, 95% CI 3.65-32.4). There was no significant change in QTc after antipsychotic administration (p = 0.064). The mean CAPD score decreased (12.5-7.2; p < 0.001). Quetiapine had the most improvement in delirium, and risperidone had the least improvement (77.8%, n = 14; 37.8%, n = 34, respectively; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The QTc interval did not have a statistically significant change after the administration of antipsychotics, while there was improvement in the CAPD score. APMs may be administered safely without significant prolongation of the QTc and are an effective treatment for delirium.."}}]}

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To determine delirium occurrence rate, duration, and severity in patients admitted to the ICU with coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Retrospective data extraction study from March 1, 2020, to June 7, 2020. Delirium outcomes were assessed for up to the first 14 days in ICU. SETTING: Two large, academic centers serving the state of Indiana. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test from March 1, 2020, to June 7, 2020, were included. Individuals younger than 18 years of age, without any delirium assessments, or without discharge disposition were excluded. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcomes were delirium rates and duration, and the secondary outcome was delirium severity. Two-hundred sixty-eight consecutive patients were included in the analysis with a mean age of 58.4 years (sd, 15.6 yr), 40.3% were female, 44.4% African American, 20.7% Hispanic, and a median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 18 (interquartile range, 13-25). Delirium without coma occurred in 29.1% of patients, delirium prior to coma in 27.9%, and delirium after coma in 23.1%. The first Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU assessment was positive for delirium in 61.9%. Hypoactive delirium was the most common subtype (87.4%). By day 14, the median number of delirium/coma-free were 5 days (interquartile range, 4-11 d), and median Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU-7 score was 6.5 (interquartile range, 5-7) indicating severe delirium. Benzodiazepines were ordered for 78.4% of patients in the cohort. Mechanical ventilation was associated with greater odds of developing delirium (odds ratio, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.1-22.2; p = 0.033) even after adjusting for sedative medications. There were no between-group differences in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium without coma occurred in 29.1% of patients admitted to the ICU. Delirium persisted for a median of 5 days and was severe. Mechanical ventilation was significantly associated with odds of delirium even after adjustment for sedatives. Clinical attention to manage delirium duration and severity, and deeper understanding of the virus' neurologic effects is needed for patients with coronavirus disease 2019.."}}]}

Abstract: Background: Despite the recommendations for delirium assessment in clinical settings, it stills remain a serious clinical problem associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, stress on the patient and family, and mortality. There is paucity of data regarding delirium assessment and prevention in developing world. The Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) was developed to aid in the assessment of delirium. There is no documented assessment of delirium and prevention in Uganda. This study evaluated the effect of an educational intervention on nurses' knowledge and practices of delirium assessment using the CAM-ICU tool. Methods: We used a quasi-experimental and recruited a convenience sample of 29 nurses from ICU and ER. The assessment before and after the interventions was conducted using a self-completed questionnaire from October 2020 to January 2021. The interventions were delivered through face-to-face presentations, demonstrations, watching videos, and hands on practice. Data were entered into excel, cleaned and exported to Stata version 14. Median and interquartile ranges were used for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. The mean knowledge score was calculated before and after the intervention. A paired t-test was used to compare Pre- and Post-test knowledge and practice scores at P <0.05. Results: Majority (62%) were female, 48% were Diploma holders, median age was 30 (IQR = 28-32) years and median years of experience 3.5 (IQR = 3-4). The Mean knowledge scores was 10.7 (SD = 2.36) pretest and 19 (0.94) posttest. The mean practice score was 2 (SD = 0.83) pretest and 6 (0.35) posttest. There were significant differences in mean knowledge and practice scores before and after intervention mean of (t (28) =17.32, p < 0.001) and (t (28) = 25.04, p<0.001), respectively. Conclusion: Educational intervention Improved nurses' knowledge and practice of delirium assessment. Continuous nursing education could improve nurses' knowledge of delirium assessment and thus quality of patient care.."}}]}

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Delirium is associated with mortality and new onset dementia, yet the underlying pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Development of imaging biomarkers has been difficult given the challenging nature of imaging delirious patients. Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) offers a promising approach for investigating delirium given its portability and three-dimensional capabilities. METHODS: Twenty-five delirious and matched non-delirious patients (n = 50) were examined using DOT, comparing cerebral oxygenation and functional connectivity in the prefrontal cortex during and after an episode of delirium. RESULTS: Total hemoglobin values were significantly decreased in the delirium group, even after delirium resolution. Functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was strengthened post-resolution compared to during an episode; however, this relationship was still significantly weaker compared to controls. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight DOT's potential as an imaging biomarker to measure impaired cerebral oxygenation and functional dysconnectivity during and after delirium. Future studies should focus on the role of cerebral oxygenation in delirium pathogenesis and exploring the etiological link between delirium and dementias. HIGHLIGHTS: We developed a portable diffuse optical tomography (DOT) system for bedside three-dimensional functional neuroimaging to study delirium in the hospital. We implemented a novel DOT task-focused seed-based correlation analysis. DOT revealed decreased cerebral oxygenation and functional connectivity strength in the delirium group, even after resolution of delirium.."}}]}

Abstract: Purpose of Review: Delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) has become increasingly acknowledged as a significant problem for critically ill patients affecting both the actual course of illness as well as outcomes. In this review, we focus on the current evidence and the gaps in knowledge. Recent Findings: This review highlights several areas in which the evidence is weak and further research is needed in both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment. A better understanding of subtypes and their different response to therapy is needed and further studies in aetiology are warranted. Larger studies are needed to explore risk factors for developing delirium and for examining long-term consequences. Finally, a stronger focus on experienced delirium and considering the perspectives of both patients and their families is encouraged. Summary: With the growing number of studies and a better framework for research leading to stronger evidence, the outcomes for patients suffering from delirium will most definitely improve in the years to come..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delirium is a frequent diagnosis made by Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (CLP). Numerous studies have demonstrated misdiagnosis prior to referral to CLP. Few studies have considered the factors underlying misdiagnosis using multivariate approaches. OBJECTIVES: To determine the number of cases referred to CLP, which are misdiagnosed at time of referral, to build an accurate predictive classifier algorithm, using input variables related to delirium misdiagnosis. METHOD: A retrospective observational study was conducted at Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, collecting data from a record of all patients seen by CLP for a period of 5 months. Data was collected pertaining to putative factors underlying misdiagnosis. A Machine Learning-Logistic Regression classifier model was built, to classify cases of accurate delirium diagnosis vs. misdiagnosis. RESULTS: Thirty five of 74 new cases referred were misdiagnosed. The proposed predictive algorithm achieved a mean Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area under the curve (AUC) of 79%, an average 72% classification accuracy, 77% sensitivity and 67% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is commonly misdiagnosed in hospital settings. Our findings support the potential application of Machine Leaning-logistic predictive classifier in health care settings..'}}]}

Abstract: Delirium in ICU patients is a complication associated with many adverse consequences. Given the high prevalence of this complication in critically ill patients, it is essential to develop and implement an effective management protocol to prevent delirium. Given that the cause of delirium is multifactorial, non-pharmacological multicomponent interventions are promising strategies for delirium prevention. (1) Background: To identify and evaluate published systematic review on non-pharmacological nursing interventions to prevent delirium in intensive care unit patients. (2) Methods: An umbrella review guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute was utilized. Data were obtained from PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. The last search was conducted on 1 May 2022. (3) Results: Fourteen reviews met the inclusion criteria. Multicomponent interventions are the most promising methods in the fight against delirium. The patient's family is an important part of the process and should be included in the delirium prevention scheme. Light therapy can improve the patient's circadian rhythm and thus contribute to reducing the incidence of delirium. (4) Conclusions: Non-pharmacological nursing interventions may be effective in preventing and reducing the duration of delirium in ICU patients.."}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delirium is a serious and distressing neurocognitive disorder of physiological aetiology that is common in advanced cancer. Understanding of delirium pathophysiology is largely hypothetical, with some evidence for involvement of inflammatory systems, neurotransmitter alterations and glucose metabolism. To date, there has been limited empirical consideration of the distinction between delirium pathophysiology and that of the underlying disease, for example, cancer where these mechanisms are also common in advanced cancer syndromes such as pain and fatigue. This systematic review explores biomarker overlap in delirium, specific advanced cancer-related syndromes and prediction of cancer prognosis. METHODS: A systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42017068662) was conducted, using MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Web of Science, to identify body fluid biomarkers in delirium, cancer prognosis and advanced cancer-related syndromes of interest. Studies were excluded if they reported delirium tremens only; did not measure delirium using a validated tool; the sample had less than 75% of participants with advanced cancer; measured tissue, genetic or animal biomarkers, or were conducted post-mortem. Articles were screened for inclusion independently by two authors, and data extraction and an in-depth quality assessment conducted by one author, and checked by two others. RESULTS: The 151 included studies were conducted in diverse settings in 32 countries between 1985 and 2017, involving 28130 participants with a mean age of 69.3 years. Seventy-one studies investigated delirium biomarkers, and 80 studies investigated biomarkers of an advanced cancer-related syndrome or cancer prognosis. Overall, 41 biomarkers were studied in relation to both delirium and either an advanced cancer-related syndrome or prognosis; and of these, 24 biomarkers were positively associated with either delirium or advanced cancer syndromes/prognosis in at least one study. The quality assessment showed large inconsistency in reporting. CONCLUSION: There is considerable overlap in the biomarkers in delirium and advanced cancer-related syndromes. Improving the design of delirium biomarker studies and considering appropriate comparator/controls will help to better understanding the discrete pathophysiology of delirium in the context of co-existing illness..'}}]}

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study sets out to ascertain if recognition of delirium impacts on patient outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Unscheduled admissions to acute care trust/secondary care UK hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred and fifty-six older adults aged >=65 years admitted on 14 September 2018. MEASUREMENTS: Delirium was ascertained retrospectively from case notes using medical notes. Documented delirium was classified as recognised delirium and retrospectively ascertained delirium was classified as unrecognised delirium. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measure: inpatient mortality. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: length of stay, discharge destination. RESULTS: Delirium was present in 21.1% (132/626) of patients at any point during admission. The presence of delirium was associated with increased mortality (HR 2.65, CI 1.40 to 5.01). Recognition of delirium did not significantly impact on outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalised older adults. However, there is insufficient evidence that recognition of delirium affects outcomes. However, delirium recognition presents an opportunity to discuss a person's overall prognosis and discuss this with the patient and their family. Further research is needed to assess the pathophysiology of delirium to enable development of targeted interventions towards improved outcomes in patients with delirium.."}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure (HF) accompanied by delirium are at risk of rehospitalization and death, thus early detection and appropriate treatment is imperative. Palliative care for patients with HF is an important issue, particularly for patients who also have delirium. This retrospective study examined the accuracy of delirium assessment by cardiologists treating patients with HF, identified factors related to the detection of delirium, and recorded the initial treatment. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart survey of 165 patients with HF referred to a consultation liaison (C-L) service during treatment in the cardiology wards of a general hospital over a 6-year period. Diagnosis of delirium by the C-L psychiatrists was based on DSM-IV-TR.Cases in which cardiologists had stated "delirium" in the medical records were classified as an accurate assessment of delirium (Agreement group). Cases in which cardiologists did not state "delirium" were classified as Disagreement. RESULTS: Among 81 patients with delirium (51 [62.9%] male; 74.7 +- 13.3 years old), the ratio of accurate assessment of delirium by cardiologists was 50.6% (n = 41; Agreement group). Age, sex, and HF severity did not differ significantly between the two groups. Although disquietedness was identified most frequently (n = 59, 73%), only 33 of these 59 patients (55.9%) were recognized as having delirium by cardiologists.Inappropriate initial treatments were only noted in the Disagreement group. In both groups, most cases were referred to a C-L service without new medication for psychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: An accurate assessment of the delirium of inpatients with HF by cardiologists was found in only around half of all cases. Accurate detection is important to avoid harmful drug administration and to provide appropriate palliative care..'}}]}

At present, there have been more and more studies and reports on delirium in paediatric intensive care unit, but there are some differences in the risk factor results among different studies. To better manage delirium, this study was performed. OBJECTIVE: To integrate and clarify the risk factors for delirium in paediatric intensive care unit. METHODS: CNKI, CBMdisc, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, VIP, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, JBI and PsycInfo were searched for relevant literature. The study subjects were patients in PICU and literature was included according to the PICOS principle. Literature screening and risk of bias assessment were mainly completed by two researchers, and RevMan 5.3 software and Stata software were used for data analysis. The GRADE systerm was used to assess the quality of evidence. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies were included, all in English, involving 4343 children. Within the GRADE system, 4 indicators were scored A, 1 indicators were scored B, and 3 indicators were scored C regarding evidence levels. Three studies analysed the influence of developmental delay on the occurrence of delirium in PICU, total sample size of which was 1823, and the results showed that the combined effect was statistically significant [OR = 3.34, 95%CI(2.46-4.53), Z = 7.75, P<0.001]; Five studies analysed the effects of mechanical ventilation on the occurrence of delirium in PICU, sample size of which was 1562, and the results showed that the combined effect was statistically significant [OR = 4.11, 95%CI(3.13-5.40), Z = 10.16, P<0.001]; Two studies analysed the effects of benzodiazepines on children developing delirium, sample size of which was 1635, and the results showed that the combined effect was statistically significant [OR = 5.05, 95%CI(3.65-6.97), Z = 9.83, P<0.001]; Two studies analysed the effects of anticholinergic drug use on children developing delirium in PICU, sample size of which was 1703, and the results suggested the combined effect was statistically significant [OR = 5.04, 95%CI (3.62-7.00), Z = 9.63, P<0.001]; Two studies compared the same age period, sample size of which was 1724 and the results showed that children 2-5 years old has a 48% incidence rate of delirium relative to children younger than 2 years old, and the combined effect was statistically significant [OR = 0.48, 95%CI(0.25-0.92), Z = 2.22, P = 0.030], children 5-13 years old has a 39% incidence rate of delirium relative to children younger than 2 years old, and the combined effect was statistically significant [OR = 0.39, 95%CI(0.26-0.59), Z = 4.43, P<0.001]. Two studies analysed the effects of PICU LOS on children developing delirium and the combined effect of PICU LOS on the occurrence of delirium in children in PICU was statistically significant [OR = 1.10, 95%CI(1.05-1.15), Z = 4.07, P<0.001]. CONCLUSION: Developmental delay, mechanical ventilation, benzodiazepine use, anticholinergic use, age and PICU length of stay are independent risk factors for delirium in children in PICU. However, only a few articles were included in this study, which may lead to a certain bias and affect the analysing results. More large-sample, multicentre studies should be conducted to further explore and clarify the independent influencing factors of delirium in children in PICU and to provide guidance for clinical practice..'}}]}

Abstract: We created a concise nurse-driven delirium reduction workflow with the aim of reducing delirium rates and length of stay for hospitalized adults. Our nurse-driven workflow included five evidence-based daytime "sunrise" interventions (patient room lights on, blinds up, mobilization/out-of-bed, water within patient\'s reach and patient awake) and five nighttime "turndown" interventions (patient room lights off, blinds down, television off, noise reduction and pre-set bedtime). Interventions were also chosen because fidelity could be quickly monitored twice daily without patient interruption from outside the room. To evaluate the workflow, we used an interrupted time series study design between 06/01/17 and 05/30/22 to determine if the workflow significantly reduced the unit\'s delirium rate and average length of stay. Our workflow is feasible to implement and monitor and initially significantly reduced delirium rates but not length of stay. However, the reduction in delirium rates were not sustained following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic..'}}]}

Abstract: Background: Delirium is a common medical condition that is highly prevalent in older adults who are at increased risk for its development with any illness, post-surgery or during hospitalization. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the health literacy of older adult patients and their caregivers about delirium, offer a brief educational intervention, and reevaluate their knowledge post intervention. Materials and Methods: We conducted a quality improvement project, focused on delirium health literacy in older adult patients >=60 years and their caregivers. Delirium knowledge of participants was evaluated in a pre-education survey after which they were given a delirium education booklet to read. A post-education delirium survey was conducted within 2-3 weeks of the educational intervention. Chi-square test was used to analyze the knowledge base of older adults. Results: The study population consisted of a total of 70 older adults who participated in pre-education (n=35) and post-education (n=35) surveys. Older adult patients and their caregivers had significant knowledge gaps about the potential causes or etiologies, risk factors, symptomatology, and prevention of delirium in the pre-education survey. After the educational intervention, in the post-education survey, there were overall improvements in knowledge base of older adults in differentiating delirium with dementia (43% vs 94%, p<0.01) recognizing signs and symptoms (77% vs 94%, p<0.05), complications (76% vs 100%, p<0.01) and identifying the etiological factors associated with delirium. Conclusion: The quality improvement project demonstrated that older adults and caregivers have significant knowledge deficits about the common condition of delirium. This study also demonstrated that older adults were able to improve their health literacy regarding delirium after the intervention. Appropriate education on delirium for patients and caregivers might help in earlier identification, prevention, and better overall management of delirium..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prognostic implication of delirium subtypes in critically ill medical and surgical patients is scarcely investigated. The objective was to determine how delirium subtypes are associated with hospital mortality and other clinical outcomes. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis on data from a prospective multicenter study aimed at implementation of delirium-oriented measures, conducted between 2012 and 2015 in The Netherlands. We included adults (>= 18 years) admitted to the medical or surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Exclusion criteria were neurological admission diagnosis, persistent coma or ICU readmissions. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU or Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist, and delirium subtypes (hypoactive, hyperactive, or mixed) were classified using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. The main outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were ICU mortality, ICU length of stay, coma, mechanical ventilation, and use of antipsychotics, sedatives, benzodiazepines and opioids. RESULTS: Delirium occurred in 381 (24.4%) of 1564 patients (52.5% hypoactive, 39.1% mixed, 7.3% hyperactive). After case-mix adjustment, patients with mixed delirium had higher hospital mortality than non-delirious patients (OR 3.09, 95%CI 1.79-5.33, p = 0.001), whereas hypoactive patients did not (OR 1.34, 95%CI 0.71-2.55, p = 0.37). Similar results were found for ICU mortality. Compared to non-delirious patients, both subtypes had longer ICU stay, more coma, increased mechanical ventilation frequency and duration, and received more antipsychotics, sedatives, benzodiazepines and opioids. Except for coma and benzodiazepine use, the most unfavourable outcomes were observed in patients with mixed delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mixed delirium had the most unfavourable outcomes, including higher mortality, compared with no delirium. These differences argue for distinguishing delirium subtypes in clinical practice and future research. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01952899..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delirium is recognised internationally as a common disorder that causes acute deterioration in a person's cognitive abilities. Healthcare professionals play a key role in the early identification and management of delirium and effective education can support timely recognition and treatment. There is currently a lack of research exploring the delirium education provided to undergraduate nursing students. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a co-produced delirium awareness programme on undergraduate nursing students in Northern Ireland. METHODS: The intervention was a 2-h delirium workshop, delivered in April 2019, to a convenience sample of year one undergraduate nursing students (n = 206) completing a BSc Honours Nursing degree programme in a Northern Ireland University. The workshop focused on four core elements: defining delirium, reflecting on practice, recognition of delirium and management of delirium. Participants completed a 35-item true-false Delirium Knowledge Questionnaire (DKQ) at baseline and post intervention using Socrative, a cloud-based student response system. In addition, students also completed a short questionnaire at baseline and post-workshop, designed by the authors, to ascertain perceived confidence about caring for people with delirium. Data were analysed using paired t-tests and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: In the DKQ, Scores were normally distributed around the mean at baseline (71.89%) and post intervention (81.89%). Students improved across all three core areas in the post-test questionnaire, demonstrating improvements in knowledge about symptoms of delirium (7.32% increase), causes and risk factors of delirium (17.91% increase) and management of delirium (5.72% increase). In relation to perceived confidence, students reported a 60.20% increase in confidence related to recognition of delirium, a 49.51% increase in relation to delirium management and a 45.04% increase their ability to communicate about delirium. Both questionnaires were statistically significant (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A 2-h workshop on delirium improved first year student nurse knowledge about delirium. Nursing students expressed that this approach to delirium education enabled collective thinking about how knowledge could be transferred into individual practises. Students also stated that learning incorporating the voice of the person who has experienced delirium, was an effective and powerful way to deliver education.."}}]}

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The large number of heterogeneous instruments in active use for identification of delirium prevents direct comparison of studies and the ability to combine results. In a recent systematic review we performed, we recommended four commonly used and well-validated instruments and subsequently harmonized them using advanced psychometric methods to develop an item bank, the Delirium Item Bank (DEL-IB). The goal of the present study was to find optimal cut-points on four existing instruments and to demonstrate use of the DEL-IB to create new instruments. METHODS: We used a secondary analysis and simulation study based on data from three previous studies of hospitalized older adults (age 65+ years) in the USA, Ireland, and Belgium. The combined dataset included 600 participants, contributing 1,623 delirium assessments, and an overall incidence of delirium of about 22%. The measurements included the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition diagnostic criteria for delirium, Confusion Assessment Method (long form and short form), Delirium Observation Screening Scale, Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (total and severity scores), and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). RESULTS: We identified different cut-points for each existing instrument to optimize sensitivity or specificity, and compared instrument performance at each cut-point to the author-defined cut-point. For instance, the cut-point on the MDAS that maximizes both sensitivity and specificity was at a sum score of 6 yielding 89% sensitivity and 79% specificity. We then created four new example instruments (two short forms and two long forms) and evaluated their performance characteristics. In the first example short form instrument, the cut-point that maximizes sensitivity and specificity was at a sum score of 3 yielding 90% sensitivity, 81% specificity, 30% positive predictive value, and 99% negative predictive value. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: We used the DEL-IB to better understand the psychometric performance of widely used delirium identification instruments and scorings, and also demonstrated its use to create new instruments. Ultimately, we hope that the DEL-IB might be used to create optimized delirium identification instruments and to spur the development of a unified approach to identify delirium..'}}]}

Abstract: Delirium is not a harmless transient event during ICU hospitalization; rather, it is a severe complication of critical illness associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and persistent disability. Despite being recognized for decades, it remains underdiagnosed. Employing validated tools for detection helps reduce missed cases. Early detection facilitates prompt management.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Delirium has been recognized as an atypical presenting feature of COVID-19 in older adults and is independently associated with mortality. We aimed to perform an updated systematic review of the literature and proportional meta-analysis to assess prevalence and incidence of delirium in older adults with COVID-19, addressing differences according to sex, frailty status, and settings. METHODS: We searched databases for English-language articles on prevalence and incidence of delirium in older adults with COVID-19, published between March 2020 and January 2023. RESULTS: Of the 1171 articles identified, 66 met selection criteria and were included in the meta-analysis (n = 35,035 participants, age-range 66-90 years old, 46.6% females). We observed similar pooled prevalence (20.6% [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 17.8-23.8%]) and incidence (21.3% [95% CI 14.7-30%]) of delirium. Pooled occurrence (both prevalence and incidence) of delirium was similar according to sex (females 21.3% [95% CI 16-27.5%] vs. males 23.8%% [95% CI 18.2-30.4%], p-value = 0.55) and study setting (nursing homes 22.5% [95% CI 14.2-33.6%] vs. hospital 20.3% [95% CI 17-24%], p = 0.68), but it was significantly higher in frail versus non-frail patients (37% [95% CI 26.6-48.8%] vs. 12.5% [95% CI 7.8-19.6%], p-value < 0.01). Delirium definitions and assessment tools largely varied across studies. CONCLUSION: This review delineates delirium as a common feature of COVID-19, particularly in frail older adults, and supports its formal inclusion among COVID-19 symptoms. The considerable heterogeneity in delirium assessment highlights the need for an operational strategy to standardize definitions and tools utilization in the management of frail older adults..

Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the critical care nurse's knowledge of ICU delirium and the effectiveness of an educational program about the recognition and assessment of ICU delirium on critical care nurse's knowledge. Methods: A quasi-experimental single group pre-test-post-test design was conducted using delirium knowledge assessment questionnaires. Results: The median post test score of overall nurses' knowledge was 76.2 (range 19.1-95.2) compared to the median pre-test score of 38.1 (range 14.3 - 61.9) indicating a significant change in nurses' knowledge after conducting the educational program (p<0.001). Conclusion: Critical care nurses' knowledge of ICU delirium was low before the intervention and increased significantly after delivering an educational program.."}}]}

Abstract: Background: Patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are at high risk of developing delirium. Lack of early detection and the inability to provide prompt management of delirium remain challenges of ICU patient care. This study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, attitude, and associated factors toward delirium among healthcare providers working in ICU. Methods: A multicenter, cross-sectional survey was conducted in comprehensive specialized hospitals from 15 April to 5 June 2023. Data were collected using a pretested, self-administered questionnaire. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed at p < 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The odds ratio with 95% CI was calculated to determine the strength of the association between independent and outcome variables. Results: A total of 202 health professionals were included in this study, with a response rate of 87%. The proportions of good, moderate, and poor knowledge about delirium in ICU were 29.21 (95% CI: 23-36), 52.48 (95% CI: 45.3-59.5) and 18.32 (95% CI:13.2-24.4), respectively. The overall proportion of negative, neutral and positive attitude were 13.9 (95% CI: 9.4-19.4), 65.8 (95% CI: 58.9-72.4) and 20.3 (95% CI: 15-26.5) respectively. Being an anesthetist and exposure to training were positively associated with a good knowledge while belief in screening tool to change care and reading, and using guidelines were positively associated with a positive attitude. However, believing the impossibility of changing the practice of delirium care, and negative attitudes were delaying factors for a good knowledge. Also, workload and poor knowledge were hindering factors for a positive attitude. Conclusion: More than half of health professionals had moderate knowledge and neutral attitude toward delirium. However, some of them had poor knowledge and a negative attitude. We recommend stakeholders prepare regular training for delirium care. Also, we urge health professionals to update themselves by reading guidelines and to use screening protocols for delirium..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The incidence of delirium is high in the intensive care unit (ICU) after cardiac surgery. The development of evidence-based care protocols for delirium management and training of nurses in this regard can ensure effective management of delirium. This quasi-experimental study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a postoperative delirium prevention, diagnosis, and intervention protocol in patients undergoing monitoring in the ICU after cardiac surgery. METHODS: This study included 64 patients who underwent cardiac surgery and met the inclusion criteria, along with 14 nurses working in the ICU. Patients were divided into control (n = 32) and intervention (n = 32) groups. The study comprised three phases: determining the incidence of delirium in the control group and the delirium diagnosis status of the nurses; providing training to nurses on postoperative delirium prevention, diagnosis and intervention protocol; implementing a preliminary study of the protocol; and finally, implementing the protocol in the intervention group. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: While there was no significant agreement in delirium diagnosis between researcher and nurses in the control group (kappa: 0.207) (p > 0.05), significant agreement was observed in the intervention group (kappa: 1.00) (p < 0.001). The delirium diagnosis rate of the nurses was 14.3% in the control group and 100% in the intervention group, which was a significant difference. The incidence of delirium was 21.9% in the control group and 9.4% in the intervention group, although the difference was not significant. CONCLUSION: Postoperative delirium prevention, diagnosis, and intervention protocol effectively enhance delirium diagnosis compliance among researchers and nurses and improve the accuracy of delirium diagnosis among postcardiac surgery ICU patients. The implementation of this protocol is recommended for delirium management in such patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was retrospectively registered at Clinicaltrials.gov on 19.02.2024 (Clinical Trials ID: NCT06268119)..'}}]}

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: risk factors for delirium in hospital inpatients are well established, but less is known about whether delirium occurring in the community or during an emergency admission to hospital care might be predicted from routine primary-care records. OBJECTIVES: identify risk factors in primary-care electronic health records (PC-EHR) predictive of delirium occurring in the community or recorded in the initial episode in emergency hospitalisation. Test predictive performance against the cumulative frailty index. DESIGN: Stage 1: case-control; Stages 2 and 3: retrospective cohort. SETTING: clinical practice research datalink: PC-EHR linked to hospital discharge data from England. SUBJECTS: Stage 1: 17,286 patients with delirium aged >=60 years plus 85,607 controls. Stages 2 and 3: patients >= 60 years (n = 429,548 in 2015), split into calibration and validation groups. METHODS: Stage 1: logistic regression to identify associations of 110 candidate risk measures with delirium. Stage 2: calibrating risk factor weights. Stage 3: validation in independent sample using area under the curve (AUC) receiver operating characteristic. RESULTS: fifty-five risk factors were predictive, in domains including: cognitive impairment or mental illness, psychoactive drugs, frailty, infection, hyponatraemia and anticholinergic drugs. The derived model predicted 1-year incident delirium (AUC = 0.867, 0.852:0.881) and mortality (AUC = 0.846, 0.842:0.853), outperforming the frailty index (AUC = 0.761, 0.740:0.782). Individuals with the highest 10% of predicted delirium risk accounted for 55% of incident delirium over 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: a risk factor model for delirium using data in PC-EHR performed well, identifying individuals at risk of new onsets of delirium. This model has potential for supporting preventive interventions..'}}]}

Abstract: Delirium is an acute and fluctuating disorder characterized by a disturbance in attention and cognition. Delirium is underdiagnosed by clinicians, but there are excellent diagnostic tools using history and physical examination that can assist clinicians in making the diagnosis in multiple settings (ie, CAM, CAM-ICU, 3D-CAM, bCAM, 4AT, and UB-CAM). Delirium is caused by underlying medical conditions and is often multifactorial, so a full diagnosis requires a careful assessment for a wide range of underlying conditions. Physical examination has not been well studied in this regard, but still can provide useful clues to the clinician..'}}]}

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Both delirium duration and delirium severity are associated with adverse patient outcomes. Serum biomarkers associated with delirium duration and delirium severity in ICU patients have not been reliably identified. We conducted our study to identify peripheral biomarkers representing systemic inflammation, impaired neuroprotection, and astrocyte activation associated with delirium duration, delirium severity, and in-hospital mortality. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Three Indianapolis hospitals. PATIENTS: Three-hundred twenty-one critically ill delirious patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We analyzed the associations between biomarkers collected at delirium onset and delirium-/coma-free days assessed through Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale/Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU, delirium severity assessed through Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU-7, and in-hospital mortality. After adjusting for age, gender, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, Charlson comorbidity score, sepsis diagnosis and study intervention group, interleukin-6, -8, and -10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, C-reactive protein, and S-100beta levels in quartile 4 were negatively associated with delirium-/coma-free days by 1 week and 30 days post enrollment. Insulin-like growth factor-1 levels in quartile 4 were not associated with delirium-/coma-free days at both time points. Interleukin-6, -8, and -10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, C-reactive protein, and S-100beta levels in quartile 4 were also associated with delirium severity by 1 week. At hospital discharge, interleukin-6, -8, and -10 retained the association but tumor necrosis factor-alpha, C-reactive protein, and S-100beta lost their associations with delirium severity. Insulin-like growth factor-1 levels in quartile 4 were not associated with delirium severity at both time points. Interleukin-8 and S-100beta levels in quartile 4 were also associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Interleukin-6 and -10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and insulin-like growth factor-1 were not found to be associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers of systemic inflammation and those for astrocyte and glial activation were associated with longer delirium duration, higher delirium severity, and in-hospital mortality. Utility of these biomarkers early in delirium onset to identify patients at a higher risk of severe and prolonged delirium, and delirium related complications during hospitalization needs to be explored in future studies..

Abstract: Delirium, a syndrome characterized by an acute change in attention, awareness and cognition, is caused by a medical condition that cannot be better explained by a pre-existing neurocognitive disorder. Multiple predisposing factors (for example, pre-existing cognitive impairment) and precipitating factors (for example, urinary tract infection) for delirium have been described, with most patients having both types. Because multiple factors are implicated in the aetiology of delirium, there are likely several neurobiological processes that contribute to delirium pathogenesis, including neuroinflammation, brain vascular dysfunction, altered brain metabolism, neurotransmitter imbalance and impaired neuronal network connectivity. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) is the most commonly used diagnostic system upon which a reference standard diagnosis is made, although many other delirium screening tools have been developed given the impracticality of using the DSM-5 in many settings. Pharmacological treatments for delirium (such as antipsychotic drugs) are not effective, reflecting substantial gaps in our understanding of its pathophysiology. Currently, the best management strategies are multidomain interventions that focus on treating precipitating conditions, medication review, managing distress, mitigating complications and maintaining engagement to environmental issues. The effective implementation of delirium detection, treatment and prevention strategies remains a major challenge for health-care organizations globally..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delirium, a common syndrome with heterogeneous etiologies and clinical presentations, is associated with poor long-term outcomes. Recording and analyzing all delirium equally could be hindering the field's understanding of pathophysiology and identification of targeted treatments. Current delirium subtyping methods reflect clinically evident features but likely do not account for underlying biology. METHODS: The Delirium Subtyping Initiative (DSI) held three sessions with an international panel of 25 experts. RESULTS: Meeting participants suggest further characterization of delirium features to complement the existing Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition Text Revision diagnostic criteria. These should span the range of delirium-spectrum syndromes and be measured consistently across studies. Clinical features should be recorded in conjunction with biospecimen collection, where feasible, in a standardized way, to determine temporal associations of biology coincident with clinical fluctuations. DISCUSSION: The DSI made recommendations spanning the breadth of delirium research including clinical features, study planning, data collection, and data analysis for characterization of candidate delirium subtypes. HIGHLIGHTS: Delirium features must be clearly defined, standardized, and operationalized. Large datasets incorporating both clinical and biomarker variables should be analyzed together. Delirium screening should incorporate communication and reasoning.."}}]}

Abstract: Delirium is an acute confusional state that is common and costly and is associated with significant functional decline and distress. It is the manifestation of acute encephalopathy and is variably called acute brain failure, acute brain dysfunction, or altered mental status. All patients are at risk for delirium, although those with more vulnerabilities (such as advanced age, exposures to other stressors like infection, and certain medications) are at higher risk. The pathophysiologic cause of delirium is not well understood. It is important to recognize patients at risk for and those with delirium and to immediately identify and treat factors contributing to it. There is no single intervention or medication to treat delirium, making it challenging to manage. Therefore, risk mitigation and prompt treatment rely on a sophisticated strategy to address the contributing factors. Delirium may be prevented or attenuated when multimodal strategies are used, thereby improving patient outcomes..'}}]}

Abstract: Background: Phenotyping analysis that includes time course is useful for understanding the mechanisms and clinical management of postoperative delirium. However, postoperative delirium has not been fully phenotyped. Hypothesis-free categorization of heterogeneous symptoms may be useful for understanding the mechanisms underlying delirium, although evidence is currently lacking. Therefore, we aimed to explore the phenotypes of postoperative delirium following invasive cancer surgery using a data-driven approach with minimal prior knowledge. Methods: We recruited patients who underwent elective invasive cancer resection. After surgery, participants completed 5 consecutive days of delirium assessments using the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R-98) severity scale. We categorized 65 (13 questionnaire items/day x 5 days) dimensional DRS-R-98 scores using unsupervised machine learning (K-means clustering) to derive a small set of grouped features representing distinct symptoms across all participants. We then reapplied K-means clustering to this set of grouped features to delineate multiple clusters of delirium symptoms. Results: Participants were 286 patients, of whom 91 developed delirium defined according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, criteria. Following the first K-means clustering, we derived four grouped symptom features: (1) mixed motor, (2) cognitive and higher-order thinking domain with perceptual disturbance and thought content abnormalities, (3) acute and temporal response, and (4) sleep-wake cycle disturbance. Subsequent K-means clustering permitted classification of participants into seven subgroups: (i) cognitive and higher-order thinking domain dominant delirium, (ii) prolonged delirium, (iii) acute and brief delirium, (iv) subsyndromal delirium-enriched, (v) subsyndromal delirium-enriched with insomnia, (vi) insomnia, and (vii) fit. Conclusion: We found that patients who have undergone invasive cancer resection can be delineated using unsupervised machine learning into three delirium clusters, two subsyndromal delirium clusters, and an insomnia cluster. Validation of clusters and research into the pathophysiology underlying each cluster will help to elucidate the mechanisms of postoperative delirium after invasive cancer surgery..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To date delirium prevalence in the adult acute Italian hospital cardiac population is unknown. In a multicenter study, we assessed the prevalence of delirium over a single day among a population of patients admitted to acute cardiac hospital wards in Italy. METHODS: This is a point prevalence study (called "Cardio Delirium Day") which involved 55 Italian cardiologic centers (23 North, 18 Central, 12 South, 2 Sardinia) that collected data on 152 patients older than 65 years hospitalized on March 15, 2023. Delirium was assessed on the same day in all patients using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit algorithm, a validated and briefly administered tool which does not require specialized training. We also collected data about clinical variables, functional and nutritional status, dementia, comorbidity, medications, and physical restraints. RESULTS: The mean sample age was 79.0 +- 10 years (33% female). Delirium was diagnosed in 25 patients (16.4%); 17.1% were hospitalized in the intensive cardiac care unit and 13.8% in the cardiology ward (p=NS). Hyperactive was the commonest subtype (48%), followed by mixed (36%) and hypoactive type (8%). In a multivariate logistic regression, male sex (odds ratio [OR] 3.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-12.26; p=0.025), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.063-0.66; p=0.008), sensorial deficit (OR 3.75, 95% CI 1.18-11.95; p=0.025), sleep deprivation (OR 5.81, 95% CI 1.47-22.9; p=0.012) and the presence of >=3 precipitating factors (OR 7.63, 95% CI 2.32-25.2; p=0.001) were independent predictors of delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium occurred in 16.4% of patients in a cardiology setting. The "Cardio Delirium Day" project might become a useful method to assess delirium over time and sensitize the interest and the culture of Italian cardiology in this important aspect of hospital care..'}}]}

Abstract: Importance: Despite discrete etiologies leading to delirium, it is treated as a common end point in hospital and in clinical trials, and delirium research may be hampered by the attempt to treat all instances of delirium similarly, leaving delirium management as an unmet need. An individualized approach based on unique patterns of delirium pathophysiology, as reflected in predisposing factors and precipitants, may be necessary, but there exists no accepted method of grouping delirium into distinct etiologic subgroups. Objective: To conduct a systematic review to identify potential predisposing and precipitating factors associated with delirium in adult patients agnostic to setting. Evidence Review: A literature search was performed of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO from database inception to December 2021 using search Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms consciousness disorders, confusion, causality, and disease susceptibility, with constraints of cohort or case-control studies. Two reviewers selected studies that met the following criteria for inclusion: published in English, prospective cohort or case-control study, at least 50 participants, delirium assessment in person by a physician or trained research personnel using a reference standard, and results including a multivariable model to identify independent factors associated with delirium. Findings: A total of 315 studies were included with a mean (SD) Newcastle-Ottawa Scale score of 8.3 (0.8) out of 9. Across 101 144 patients (50 006 [50.0%] male and 49 766 [49.1%] female patients) represented (24 015 with delirium), studies reported 33 predisposing and 112 precipitating factors associated with delirium. There was a diversity of factors associated with delirium, with substantial physiological heterogeneity. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review, a comprehensive list of potential predisposing and precipitating factors associated with delirium was found across all clinical settings. These findings may be used to inform more precise study of delirium's heterogeneous pathophysiology and treatment.."}}]}

Abstract: Importance: The ability to rate delirium severity is key to providing optimal care for older adults, and such ratings would allow clinicians to target patients with severe delirium and monitor response to treatment, recovery time, and prognosis; assess nursing burden and staffing needs; and, ultimately, provide more appropriate patient-centered care. Current delirium severity measures have been limited in their content, gradations, and measurement characteristics. Objective: To examine the internal consistency, reliability, and validity for clinical outcomes of the DEL-S delirium severity score, a measure of delirium severity that was developed using advanced psychometric approaches, analogous to those of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System initiative. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study was conducted at a large academic medical center in Boston, Massachusetts. Adults aged 70 years or older who were admitted or transferred to medical or surgical services as either emergency or elective admissions were enrolled between October 20, 2015, and March 15, 2017, and were monitored for 1 year. Data analysis was performed from June 2020 to August 2021. Exposures: Delirium severity, measured by scores on the delirium severity score short-form (SF; 6 items, scored 0-13, with higher scores indicating more severe delirium) and long-form (LF; 17 items, scored 0-21), considered continuously and grouped into 5 categories. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were in-hospital outcomes, including length of stay and hospital costs, and posthospital (30, 90, and 365 days) outcomes, including death, health care costs, and rehospitalization. Results: The 352 participants had a median (IQR) age of 79.7 (74.6-85.5) years, 204 (58.0%) were women, and they were highly educated (median [IQR] duration of education, 14 [7-20] years). Patients in the highest delirium severity score SF group (scores 6-9) had a longer length of stay (13.3 vs 6.9 days; P for trend < .001), greater in-hospital costs ($57 700 vs $34 200), greater cumulative health care costs ($168 700 vs $106 500; P for trend = .01), and increased mortality at 1 year (50% vs 17%; P for trend = .02) compared with patients in the lowest delirium severity score SF group (score 0). Similar trends and significant findings were demonstrated for the delirium severity score LF. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that the delirium severity score provides an approach for measuring delirium severity that is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in a direct exposure-response association and that the delirium severity score may help advance patient-centered care for delirium..'}}]}

Abstract: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in older adults, mainly due to several age-related risk factors. Symptoms of UTI are atypical in the elderly population, like hypotension, tachycardia, urinary incontinence, poor appetite, drowsiness, frequent falls, and delirium. UTI manifests more commonly and specifically for this age group as delirium or confusion in the absence of a fever. This systematic review aims to highlight the relationship between UTI and delirium in the elderly population by understanding the pathologies individually and collectively. A systematic review is conducted by searching PubMed with regular keywords and major Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) keywords, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria consisted of studies based on male and female human populations above the age of 65 in the English language, available in full text published between 2017 and 2022. However, the exclusion criteria were animal studies, clinical trials, literature published before 2017, and papers published in any other language except English. A total of 106 articles were identified, and nine final studies were selected after a quality assessment, following which a valid relationship between delirium and UTI was identified in this systematic review..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Differences in short-term cognitive function between mechanically ventilated patients treated with multicomponent interventions and those receiving routine nursing care have not been established because of the lack of follow-up in previous studies. PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of the pain, agitation, and delirium (PAD) care bundle on delirium occurrence and clinical outcomes, specifically in terms of short-term cognitive function, in mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS: Data on 243 patients with mechanical ventilation were analyzed from January 2017 to February 2019. The eligible patients were divided randomly into two groups. The control group ( n = 120) received usual care, whereas the intervention group ( n = 123) received the PAD bundle, including pain monitoring and management, light sedation and daily awakening, early mobility, sleep promotion, and delirium monitoring. The incidence and duration of delirium, ventilator time, and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay were compared between the two groups. Upon discharge from the ICU and at 3 and 6 months after discharge, cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The incidence of delirium was reduced significantly in the intervention group, and significant decreases in the duration of delirium, ventilator time, and ICU length of stay were found. Cognitive impairment in the intervention group was significantly lower at the 3-month follow-up assessment. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The PAD bundle was shown to be associated with a lower incidence of delirium and improved clinical outcomes. Short-term cognitive impairment occurred in fewer patients who were managed with the PAD bundle after ICU discharge. Our findings indicate that the PAD bundle has the potential to improve clinical outcomes. The administrative staff of ICUs should use strategies, such as interdisciplinary teamwork, to facilitate the buy-in and implementation of interventions..'}}]}

Abstract: PURPOSE: Delirium is an underdiagnosed complication on intensive care units (ICU). We hypothesized that a score-based delirium detection using the Nudesc score identifies more patients compared to a traditional diagnosis of delirium by ICU physicians. METHODS: In this retrospective study, all patients treated on a general medical ICU with 30 beds in a university hospital in 2019 were analyzed. Primary outcome was a documented physician diagnosis of delirium, or a delirium score >=2 using the Nudesc. RESULTS: In 205/943 included patients (21.7%), delirium was diagnosed by ICU physicians compared to 438/943 (46.4%; ratio 2.1) by Nudesc>=2. Both assessments were independent predictors of ICU stay (p<0.01). The physician diagnosis however was no independent predictor of mortality (OR 0.98 (0.57-1.72); p = 0.989), in contrast to the score-based diagnosis (OR 2.31 (1.30-4.10); p = 0.004). Subgroup analysis showed that physicians underdiagnosed delirium in case of hypoactive delirium and delirium in patients with female gender and in patients with an age below 60 years. CONCLUSION: Delirium in patients with hypoactive delirium, female patients and those below 60 years was underdiagnosed by physicians. The score-based delirium diagnosis detected delirium more frequently and correlated with ICU mortality and stay..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Previous observational studies have reported that delirium has an association with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and that patients with AD have a higher risk of developing delirium. However, due to the limitations of observational study, it is challenging to confirm whether delirium has a causal effect on AD or reverse causation exists. METHODS: A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to investigate the relationship between delirium and AD. Summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of delirium and AD phenotypes were utilized. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the main analysis approach, and additional analyses were performed using MR Egger, weighted median, simple mode and weighted mode to ensure result accuracy. Heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy were assessed using Cochran's Q statistics and MR Egger intercept, separately. RESULTS: The MR analyses showed that genetically predicted delirium was not associated with AD (IVW: odds ratio [OR] 0.98, 95% CI 0.91-1.05, P = 0.544; MR Egger: OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83-1.15, P = 0.780; weighted median: OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88-1.05, P = 0.323; simple mode: OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80-1.04, P = 0.212; weighted mode: OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83-1.05, P = 0.277). However, in the reverse direction, AD was associated with delirium (IVW: OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.13-1.54, P = 3.91E-04; MR Egger: OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02-1.98, P = 5.60E-02; Weighted median: OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.18-1.63, P = 8.22E-05; Simple mode: OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.10-1.80, P = 1.41E-02; Weighted mode: OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.16-1.67, P = 3.23E-03). CONCLUSION: Based on the results of our MR study, there is no bidirectional causality between delirium and AD, delirium is not associated with an increased risk of AD, while genetically predicted AD is a potential causal risk factor for delirium.."}}]}

Abstract: Delirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome with multifactorial pathophysiology, encompassing a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and its management remains a significant challenge in critical care. Although often managed with antipsychotics, like haloperidol, current research has predominantly focused on dopamine dysregulation as the primary driver of delirium, overlooking its broader neuroanatomical and neurochemical underpinnings. This has led to a majority of research focusing on haloperidol as a treatment for intensive care unit (ICU) delirium. Our review critically evaluates the role of haloperidol in ICU delirium management, particularly in light of recent large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have primarily focused on delirium-free days and mortality as the primary endpoints. These studies highlight an limited understanding of the true nature of delirium treatment, which requires a broader, neuropsychiatric approach. We argue that future research should shift focus to neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation and psychosis and explore the clinical and functional benefits of reducing these distressing symptoms. Additionally, the stratification of delirium by subtypes and etiology, the enhancement of detection tools, and the adoption of multi-intervention and multi-disciplinary care approaches should be prioritized. Despite the methodological flaws in these studies, the findings support the safety of haloperidol in the ICU setting, with minimal risk of adverse events, particularly cardiac and neuropsychiatric. Moving forward, delirium research must integrate modern neuroscientific understanding and adopt more multi-disciplinary input and nuanced, patient-centered approaches to truly advance clinical care and outcomes..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delirium is an extremely common hospital complication. No study to date has assessed whether a priori defined covariates; type of hospital setting and year of study publication, influence the relationship between delirium and mortality. This is also the first study to examine the longitudinal trend of delirium-associated mortality over recent decades, to analyse the trajectory of our efforts in combating this disease. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO, were searched from January 1981 to May 2018 for English-language primary articles. Rigorous title and abstract screen and full-text screen were conducted independently by two reviewers. This paper adhered to MOOSE guidelines. Data was extracted independently by one reviewer using standardised data-collection sheets, with a separate reviewer verifying for accuracy. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Unadjusted effect sizes and event counts were analysed with a random effects model in primary meta-analysis and meta-regression, whereas a mixed effect model was used in secondary sub-group analysis. Mortality data at longest follow-up and cumulative mortality (hospital mortality combined with mortality at longest follow-up) data were analysed. RESULTS: As part of a larger project, 446 of 6790 articles were retrieved, including 71 studies that measured mortality. Our results demonstrate that elderly inpatients with delirium had significantly greater odds of mortality (OR 3.18 [95%CI: 2.73, 3.70]) compared to non-delirious controls. Patients with delirium in the ICU had the highest odds for mortality (OR: 7.09 [95%CI: 3.60, 14.0]); double the risk compared to the average. Curiously, despite advancements in delirium research, delirium associated in-hospital odds of mortality has not changed in 30 years. CONCLUSION: This is the largest meta-analysis to confirm the association between delirium and mortality, in older (age >= 65) hospital inpatients. The current meta-analysis highlights the significant odds of mortality after an episode of delirium, and these odds are much higher for ICU patients. However, in contrast to other medical conditions that have seen a decrease in associated mortality over the past few decades, delirium associated mortality remains unchanged. These findings underscore the urgent need for better delirium treatments. PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42018098627, https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=98627..'}}]}

Abstract: In the ideal intensive care unit (ICU) of the future, all patients are free from delirium, a syndrome of brain dysfunction frequently observed in critical illness and associated with worse ICU-related outcomes and long-term cognitive impairment. Although screening for delirium requires limited time and effort, this devastating disorder remains underestimated during routine ICU care. The COVID-19 pandemic brought a catastrophic reduction in delirium monitoring, prevention, and patient care due to organizational issues, lack of personnel, increased use of benzodiazepines and restricted family visitation. These limitations led to increases in delirium incidence, a situation that should never be repeated. Good sedation practices should be complemented by novel ICU design and connectivity, which will facilitate non-pharmacological sedation, anxiolysis and comfort that can be supplemented by balanced pharmacological interventions when necessary. Improvements in the ICU sound, light control, floor planning, and room arrangement can facilitate a healing environment that minimizes stressors and aids delirium prevention and management. The fundamental prerequisite to realize the delirium-free ICU, is an awake non-sedated, pain-free comfortable patient whose management follows the A to F (A-F) bundle. Moreover, the bundle should be expanded with three additional letters, incorporating humanitarian care: gaining (G) insight into patient needs, delivering holistic care with a 'home-like' (H) environment, and redefining ICU architectural design (I). Above all, the delirium-free world relies upon people, with personal challenges for critical care teams to optimize design, environmental factors, management, time spent with the patient and family and to humanize ICU care..

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that is frequently associated with cognitive disorders. These can arise directly from the primary disease, or be triggered by external factors in susceptible individuals due to PD or other predisposing factors. The cognitive disorders encompass PD-associated cognitive impairment (PD-CI), delirium, PD treatment-associated cognitive side effects, cognitive non-motor fluctuations, and PD-associated psychosis. Accurate diagnosis of delirium is crucial because it often stems from an underlying disease that may be severe and require specific treatment. However, overlapping molecular mechanisms are thought to be involved in both delirium and PD, leading to similar clinical symptoms. Additionally, there is a bidirectional interaction between delirium and PD-CI, resulting in frequent concurrent processes that further complicate diagnosis. No reliable biomarker is currently available for delirium, and the diagnosis is primarily based on clinical criteria. However, the screening tools validated for diagnosing delirium in the general population have not been specifically validated for PD. Our review addresses the current challenges in the diagnosis of these cognitive disorders and highlights existing gaps within this field.."}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Long-term care facilities (LCFs) in South Korea have limited knowledge of and capability to care for patients with delirium. They also often lack an electronic medical record system. These barriers hinder systematic approaches to delirium monitoring and intervention. Therefore, this study aims to develop a web-based app for delirium prevention in LCFs and analyse its feasibility and usability. METHODS: The app was developed based on the validity of the AI prediction model algorithm. A total of 173 participants were selected from LCFs to participate in a study to determine the predictive risk factors for delerium. The app was developed in five phases: (1) the identification of risk factors and preventive intervention strategies from a review of evidence-based literature, (2) the iterative design of the app and components of delirium prevention, (3) the development of a delirium prediction algorithm and cloud platform, (4) a pilot test and validation conducted with 33 patients living in a LCF, and (5) an evaluation of the usability and feasibility of the app, completed by nurses (Main users). RESULTS: A web-based app was developed to predict high risk of delirium and apply preventive interventions accordingly. Moreover, its validity, usability, and feasibility were confirmed after app development. By employing machine learning, the app can predict the degree of delirium risk and issue a warning alarm. Therefore, it can be used to support clinical decision-making, help initiate the assessment of delirium, and assist in applying preventive interventions. CONCLUSIONS: This web-based app is evidence-based and can be easily mobilised to support care for patients with delirium in LCFs. This app can improve the recognition of delirium and predict the degree of delirium risk, thereby helping develop initiatives for delirium prevention and providing interventions. Moreover, this app can be extended to predict various risk factors of LCF and apply preventive interventions. Its use can ultimately improve patient safety and quality of care..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The identification of the modifiable lifestyle factors including dietary habits in older adults of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and early effective interventions are of great importance. OBJECTIVES: We studied whether the consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits was different between cognitively unimpaired (CU) and cognitively impaired (CI) population and mainly investigated the associations between vegetable and fruit consumption and PET and plasma AD biomarkers in older CU adults with higher beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Older adults with the age of 50-85 years were enrolled for a cross-sectional and longitudinal study. The groups depended on whether the participants were CU or CI. Partial participants whose habits remained unchanged were followed up. MEASUREMENTS: The consumption data of vegetables and fruits were collected using a validated self-reported questionnaire. We mainly investigated the associations between vegetable and fruit consumption and various biomarkers in CU participants with positive 18F-florbetapir PET scan (Abeta-PET), part of whom also underwent plasma AD biomarkers tests and 18F-MK6240 PET scan (tau-PET). Correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between vegetable and fruit consumption and AD biomarkers. RESULTS: A total of 1433 participants were enrolled, of which CU accounted for 49.4 %. Most of the intake habits of vegetables and fruits was different between CU and CI participants. 177 CU participants with Abeta-PET positive were selected for the following study. Multiple linear regression analysis showed higher consumption of fresh vegetables (>200 g/d), dark vegetables (>100 g/d, >=2d/week), fruits (>100 g/d), berries (>100 g/d) and grapes (>100 g/d) more or less had associations with the plasma biomarkers including Abeta40, t-Tau, p-Tau-181 and neurofilament light chain as well as amyloid and Tau PET biomarkers. Most of the habits were associated with the change of cognitive function after an approximately two-year follow-up. Especially, higher intakes of fruits and grapes correlated with both lower Abeta and Tau burden and inversely with cognitive decline after follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our data indicates that higher consumption of vegetables, dark vegetables, fruits, berries and grapes is associated with amyloid and Tau PET and plasma biomarkers in preclinical AD participants and the changes of cognitive function after follow-up. Higher intakes of fruits (>100 g/d) and grapes (>100 g/d) may be more helpful for reducing the risk of AD development..

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Platelet factor 4 (PF4), a chemotactic factor secreted from the alpha-granules of platelets, has recently been proved to mitigate neuroinflammation and improve aging-related cognition decline, which may be involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the alterations of serum PF4 levels in AD, the correlation between serum PF4 and beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the potential diagnostic utility of PF4 in AD. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 38 amyloid-positive AD patients and 50 cognitively normal controls. The levels of serum PF4 were detected using the Human CXCL4/PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Kit. The levels of CSF Abeta42, Abeta40, p-tau181, and t-tau were measured on the fully-automated Lumipulse G1200 platform via commercially available kits. RESULTS: The levels of serum PF4 were significantly decreased in AD patients (5163.51 (3198.24-6301.15) vs. 5859.29 (4126.06-8006.70), Z = -2.30, P = 0.021). The negative correlation between AD diagnosis (beta = -1972.292, P = 0.009) and PF4 levels retained after the adjustments of age, sex, APOE epsilon4 status, platelet count, platelet distribution width (PDW), and comorbidity of dyslipidemia in the multiple linear regression analysis. Further analysis showed that serum PF4 levels were positively correlated with CSF Abeta42 levels and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and negatively correlated with CSF t-tau levels. Besides, the area under the curve (AUC) of serum PF4 for AD (AUC = 0.6437, P = 0.022) was comparable to that of CSF Abeta40 (AUC = 0.6400) yet lower than those of CSF Abeta42, ptau181, and t-tau. The AUC slightly increased when combining serum PF4 with other CSF AD biomarkers separately. CONCLUSIONS: The serum levels of PF4 were decreased in AD patients and were significantly correlated with the cognitive function and CSF levels of Abeta42 and t-tau. PF4 may become a promising anti-aging and therapeutic target for AD, which is worthy of further study.."}}]}

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is presented with a progressive loss of memory, a decline in cognitive abilities and multiple changes in behavior. Its pathogenicity has been linked to genetic factors in approximately 60-80% of the cases specifically APOE gene family and as well as other gene families. This study utilized advanced computational biology methods to analyze AD-associated nsSNPs extracted from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog. Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) is used to annotate the variants associated with AD. Annotated missense variants were subjected to PolyPhen-2, SNPs&Go, PredictSNP servers which were used to predict pathogenicity of selected missense variants by protein sequence information. DynaMut and DUET servers were applied to determine protein stability due to the amino acid change by integrating protein structure information. Missense variations associated with AD were annotated to 26 proteins and further analyzed in our study. Following rigorous data filtration steps, 15 candidate variants (13 proteins) were identified and subjected to sequence and structure-based analysis. Finally in this in-silico study, five deleterious non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) were identified in ACKR2(V41A), APOE(R176C), ATP8B4(G395S), LAMB2(E987K), and TOMM40(R239W), and these findings were subsequently backed-up by existing in-vivo and in-vitro literature. This study not only provides invaluable insight into the intricate pathogenic mechanisms underlying AD but also offers a distinctive perspective that paves the way for future, more comprehensive investigations aimed at unraveling the molecular intricacies responsible for the development and progression of AD. Nonetheless, it is imperative that further rigorous in vivo and in vitro experiments are conducted to validate and expand upon the findings presented here.."}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: While some literature on clinical outcomes in persons with dementia-related psychosis exists, little is known regarding Alzheimer's disease-related psychosis (ADP). OBJECTIVE: Describe demographic/clinical characteristics of adults with ADP and estimate incidence of clinical events by antipsychotic treatment status. METHODS: This cohort study identified adults >=65 years with Alzheimer's disease and incident psychosis (US Medicare database [2013-2018]) and no prior exposure to antipsychotics. Two nonmutually exclusive ADP subcohorts included: patients who initiated treatment with antipsychotic medications (antipsychotic users) and those who remained untreated (antipsychotic nonusers). Baseline characteristics were evaluated before psychosis diagnosis in untreated patients and before antipsychotic initiation in treated patients. Incidence rates were estimated for falls and fractures (composite and separately), seizure/epilepsy (new onset and any), and mortality. RESULTS: 145,333 ADP antipsychotic nonusers and 49,452 antipsychotic users were identified. Both cohorts had similar baseline demographics; however, antipsychotic users versus nonusers had higher baseline skilled nursing facility use (40.3% and 27.8%), mood (72.7% and 62.1%) and anxiety (70.9% and 57.3%) disorders, falls/fractures (39.5% and 33.8%), urinary tract infections (55.1% and 47.0%), and frailty index scores (76.0% and 69.7%). Crude incidence rates (95% confidence interval)/100 person-years in antipsychotic users and nonusers were 70.0 (68.9-71.2) and 55.8 (55.4-56.1) (falls/fractures composite), 69.0 (67.9-70.1) and 54.9 (54.5-55.2) (falls), 38.6 (38.1-39.0) and 33.0 (32.7-33.2) (mortality), and 45.8 (44.9-46.7) and 54.2 (53.9-54.6) (any seizure/epilepsy). CONCLUSIONS: Antipsychotic initiators with ADP had a higher burden of some baseline comorbidities; experienced higher incidence of falls, fractures, and mortality; and had lower incidence of seizure/epilepsy than antipsychotic nonusers.."}}]}

Abstract: Background: The exposome (e.g., totality of environmental exposures) and its role in Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) are increasingly critical areas of study. However, little is known about how interventions on the exposome, including personal behavioral modification or policy-level interventions, may impact AD/ADRD disease burden at the population level in real-world settings and the cost-effectiveness of interventions. Methods: We performed a critical review to discuss the challenges in modeling exposome interventions on population-level AD/ADRD burden and the potential of using agent-based modeling (ABM) and other advanced data science methods for causal inference to achieve this. Results: We describe how ABM can be used for empirical causal inference modeling and provide a virtual laboratory for simulating the impacts of personal and policy-level interventions. These hypothetical experiments can provide insight into the optimal timing, targeting, and duration of interventions, identifying optimal combinations of interventions, and can be augmented with economic analyses to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of interventions. We also discuss other data science methods, including structural equation modeling and Mendelian randomization. Lastly, we discuss challenges in modeling the complex exposome, including high dimensional and sparse data, the need to account for dynamic changes over time and over the life course, and the role of exposome burden scores developed using item response theory models and artificial intelligence to address these challenges. Conclusions: This critical review highlights opportunities and challenges in modeling exposome interventions on population-level AD/ADRD disease burden while considering the cost-effectiveness of different interventions, which can be used to aid data-driven policy decisions.."}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia in seniors and is also one of the critical social issues of modern healthcare. Since AD is considered a multifactorial disease, the significance of particular risk factors in different ethnic populations is constantly reevaluated. METHOD: The study group consisted of 181 patients with AD, and the control group included 244 healthy seniors comparable in sex and age to the dementia group. Our study compared clinical data, blood biochemical parameters, various sociodemographic characteristics, and ApoE gene polymorphism in patients diagnosed with AD from Kazakhstan's north (Astana city) and south (Almaty city) regions. RESULTS: In our cohort, significant dementia-associated variables included smoking, clinically significant depression, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and liver dysfunction. Notably, AD patients had higher HDL levels, lower ALT levels, and higher total bilirubin and AST/ALT ratios. The ApoE e4 genotype, a well-known AD risk factor, was more prevalent in the northern AD group. Additionally, participants from Astana city had a higher incidence of strokes, potentially linked to elevated LDL levels, while Almaty city residents exhibited a higher prevalence of clinically severe depression. DISCUSSION: These findings underscore the importance of considering bio-geographic and environmental factors in AD research. The study's outcomes may aid in further research and the development of personalized approaches for managing and treating AD in distinct geographical regions.."}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Combined art activities can improve the neural network function within various brain regions involved in emotions, cognition, and behavior, thereby preventing or reversing cognitive decline. However, few studies have systematically examined its effects. Furthermore, the impact of nurse-led art-based cognitive intervention on cognitive and psychological health is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a nurse-led staged integral art-based cognitive intervention in older adults on the Alzheimer's disease spectrum. DESIGN: This was a randomized wait-list controlled trial with allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors and data analysts. All data were collected between April 2021 and January 2023 and analyzed from January to March 2023. SETTING: One memory clinic and four medical partnership communities. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 144 participants with subjective or objective memory decline (aged >=60 years). METHODS: Participants were randomized into an intervention group (n = 72) and a wait-list control group (n = 72), in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group underwent a 16-week, 24-session nurse-led staged integral art-based cognitive intervention program, which was based on neurocognitive function training patterns. The control group underwent the program after the follow-up assessment. General and specific domains of cognitive function and other health-related outcomes were measured at baseline (T0), immediately after the intervention (T1), and at the 6-month follow-up (T2). RESULTS: Of the 144 participants (mean [SD] age, 71.6 [5.8] years; 50 [34.7 %] males and 94 [65.3 %] females), 130 and 115 completed the questionnaires at T1 and T2, respectively. The average attendance rate in the intervention group was 86.0 %. At T1, the intervention group showed greater improvement than the control group did in general cognitive functions (MoCA, between-group mean difference, 1.4 [95 % CIs, 0.4 to 2.5], p = 0.009). Additionally, the intervention group demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to the control group in language, memory, quality of life, sleep quality and physical activity level at T1. Statistically significant group differences remained in sleep quality (PSQI, between-group mean difference, -1.3 [95 % CIs, -2.5 to -0.1], p = 0.035) at the 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized controlled trial of a nurse-led staged integral art-based cognitive intervention program, older adults on the Alzheimer's disease spectrum who participated in the program experienced improved cognition and psychological health. REGISTRATION: This study was registered with ChiCTR.org (ChiCTR2100044959) on April 3, 2021. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: A nurse-led staged integral art-based intervention for older adults on the Alzheimer's disease spectrum experienced improved cognition and psychological health.."}}]}

Abstract: PURPOSE: To explore the effects of family audio recordings on depression, cognitive function, and sleep quality among individuals with Alzheimer's disease in nursing homes. METHOD: A randomized controlled study design was used, and 107 participants with Alzheimer's disease were stratified and randomly assigned to groups based on Clinical Dementia Rating Scale scores. The control group received usual care and health education, and the experimental group received usual care, health education, and a family audio recording intervention. RESULTS: The experimental group showed significantly lower depression scores compared to the control group post-intervention. A within-group comparison of sleep quality scores in the experimental group was significantly different. At post-intervention, cognitive function scores in the control group significantly decreased compared to before the intervention. CONCLUSION: Family audio recording interventions helped alleviate depression symptoms in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, improved their sleep quality, and delayed the progression of cognitive decline to some extent.

Abstract: Significant insights into the function of genes associated with Alzheimer disease and related dementias have occurred through studying genetically modified animals. Although none of the existing models fully reproduces the complete spectrum of this insidious human disease, critical aspects of Alzheimer pathology and disease processes can be experimentally recapitulated. Genetically modified animal models have helped advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of disease and have proven to be invaluable in the preclinical evaluation of potential therapeutic interventions. Continuing refinement and evolution to yield the next generation of animal models will facilitate successes in producing greater translational concordance between preclinical studies and human clinical trials and eventually lead to the introduction of novel therapies into clinical practice..'}}]}

Abstract: Epigenetic modifications help orchestrate sweeping developmental, aging, and disease-causing changes in phenotype by altering transcriptional activity in multiple genes spanning multiple biologic pathways. Although previous epigenetic research has focused primarily on dividing cells, particularly in cancer, recent studies have shown rapid, dynamic, and persistent epigenetic modifications in neurons that have significant neuroendocrine, neurophysiologic, and neurodegenerative consequences. Here, we provide a review of the major mechanisms for epigenetic modification and how they are reportedly altered in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because of their reach across the genome, epigenetic mechanisms may provide a unique integrative framework for the pathologic diversity and complexity of AD.."}}]}

Abstract: The opioid peptides dynorphins may be involved in pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) by inducing neurodegeneration or cognitive impairment. To test this hypothesis, the dynorphin system was analyzed in postmortem samples from AD and control subjects, and subjects with Parkinson or cerebro-vascular diseases for comparison. Dynorphin A, dynorphin B and related neuropeptide nociceptin were determined in the Brodmann area 7 by radioimmunoassay. The precursor protein prodynorphin, processing convertase PC2 and the neuroendocrine pro7B2 and 7B2 proteins required for PC2 maturation were analyzed by Western blot. AD subjects displayed robustly elevated levels of dynorphin A and no differences in dynorphin B and nociceptin compared to controls. Subjects with Parkinson or cerebro-vascular diseases did not differ from controls with respect to any of the three peptides. PC2 levels were also increased, whereas, those of prodynorphin and pro7B2/7B2 were not changed in AD. Dynorphin A levels correlated with the neuritic plaque density. These results along with the known non-opioid ability of dynorphin A to induce neurodegeneration suggest a role for this neuropeptide in AD neuropathology..'}}]}

2025-03-04 06:28:57,152 - INFO - Error in parsing the instance Title: Secretase as a target for Alzheimer's disease. Abstract: The amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is the major protein component of the characteristic cerebral plaques of Alzheimer s disease (AD), and a large body of evidence supports a pathogenic role for this peptide. Thus, the proteases beta- and gamma-secretase that are responsible for carving Abeta out of its precursor protein are considered prime targets for therapeutic design. beta-Secretase is a membrane-anchored aspartyl protease of the pepsin family, while gamma-secretase is much more complex. gamma-Secretase requires presenilin, a multipass membrane protein that is the site of dozens of missense mutations that alter Abeta formation and cause hereditary AD. Two conserved aspartates in presenilin are required for gamma-secretase activity, and aspartyl protease transition-state analogue inhibitors of gamma-secretase bind directly to presenilins, strong evidence that presenilin is the catalytic component of a novel membrane aspartyl protease. gamma-Secretase appears to be a multi-component complex of integral membrane proteins, and so far presenilin and a single-pass membrane protein called nicastrin have been identified as members of this complex. A closely similar or identical protease activity is essential for a signaling pathway critical for embryogenesis and hematopoiesis, raising concerns about gamma-secretase as a target. The development of potent and selective inhibitors with good pharmacokinetic properties may soon address these concerns..

Abstract: The amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is the major protein component of the characteristic cerebral plaques of Alzheimer s disease (AD), and a large body of evidence supports a pathogenic role for this peptide. Thus, the proteases beta- and gamma-secretase that are responsible for carving Abeta out of its precursor protein are considered prime targets for therapeutic design. beta-Secretase is a membrane-anchored aspartyl protease of the pepsin family, while gamma-secretase is much more complex. gamma-Secretase requires presenilin, a multipass membrane protein that is the site of dozens of missense mutations that alter Abeta formation and cause hereditary AD. Two conserved aspartates in presenilin are required for gamma-secretase activity, and aspartyl protease transition-state analogue inhibitors of gamma-secretase bind directly to presenilins, strong evidence that presenilin is the catalytic component of a novel membrane aspartyl protease. gamma-Secretase appears to be a multi-component complex of integral membrane proteins, and so far presenilin and a single-pass membrane protein called nicastrin have been identified as members of this complex. A closely similar or identical protease activity is essential for a signaling pathway critical for embryogenesis and hematopoiesis, raising concerns about gamma-secretase as a target. The development of potent and selective inhibitors with good pharmacokinetic properties may soon address these concerns.."}}]}

All individuals completed the BCIS, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: Mean scores of the HADS-depression subscale, HAMD, BCIS-self-reflectiveness (BCIS-R), and BCIS-self-certainty (BCIS-C) subscales were significantly different between the patients and the controls. However, there was no significant difference in BCIS reflectiveness-certainty index scores between the patients and the control groups. Regression analyses showed a moderately positive correlation between hallucinations and BCIS-C scores. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to investigate cognitive insight in patients with probable AD. The BCIS-R and BCIS-C scores were significantly lower in patients than in control group.."}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The population aging, together with the shrinking caring potential of families, is a major challenge for social policy in the coming years. The aim of the study is to identify the factors that determine not only the use of long-term care (LTC) but also the selection of individual types of such care in Poland. METHODS: Using unique data collected from inpatient LTC facilities in Poland and the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) database, we estimate logistic regressions explaining the choice of LTC solution. RESULTS: Our results suggest that social inequalities play a role in choosing the type of LTC. Better educated people choose private institutions, while people without support network use more often social residential homes. The impact of multimorbidity on choosing different types of inpatient facilities is limited, thus the number of ADL limitations remains a better indicator of long term care utilization. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms that social inequalities influence decisions about the choice of LTC. However, multi-morbidity is a predictor of using LTC to a limited extent. The differences in LTC selection determinants between women and men are noticeable..'}}]}

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The symptoms and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia contribute to the public's negative reactions toward individuals with AD dementia and their families. But what if, using AD biomarker tests, diagnosis was made before the onset of dementia, and a disease-modifying treatment was available? This study tests the hypotheses that a "preclinical" diagnosis of AD and treatment that improves prognosis will mitigate stigmatizing reactions. METHODS: A sample of U.S. adults were randomized to receive one vignette created by a 3 x 2 x 2 vignette-based experiment that described a person with varied clinical symptom severity (Clinical Dementia Rating stages 0 (no dementia), 1 (mild), or 2 (moderate)), AD biomarker test results (positive vs negative), and disease-modifying treatment (available vs not available). Between-group comparisons were conducted of scores on the Modified Family Stigma in Alzheimer's Disease Scale (FS-ADS). RESULTS: The sample of 1,817 adults had a mean age two years younger than that of U.S. adults but was otherwise similar to the general adult population. The response rate was 63% and the completion rate was 96%. In comparisons of randomized groups, mild and moderate symptoms of dementia evoked stronger reactions on all FS-ADS domains compared to no dementia (all p < 0.001). A positive biomarker test result evoked stronger reactions on all but one FS-ADS domain (negative aesthetic attributions) compared to a negative biomarker result (all p < 0.001). Disease-modifying treatment had no measurable influence on stigma (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The stigmas of dementia spill over into preclinical AD, and availability of treatment does not alter that stigma. Translation of the preclinical AD construct from research into practice will require interventions that mitigate AD stigma to preserve the dignity and identity of individuals living with AD..

RESULTS: The sample of 1,817 adults had a mean age two years younger than that of U.S. adults but was otherwise similar to the general adult population. The response rate was 63% and the completion rate was 96%. In comparisons of randomized groups, mild and moderate symptoms of dementia evoked stronger reactions on all FS-ADS domains compared to no dementia (all p < 0.001). A positive biomarker test result evoked stronger reactions on all but one FS-ADS domain (negative aesthetic attributions) compared to a negative biomarker result (all p < 0.001). Disease-modifying treatment had no measurable influence on stigma (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The stigmas of dementia spill over into preclinical AD, and availability of treatment does not alter that stigma. Translation of the preclinical AD construct from research into practice will require interventions that mitigate AD stigma to preserve the dignity and identity of individuals living with AD..

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Considerable uncertainty remains regarding associations of multiple risk factors with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to systematically screen and validate a wide range of potential risk factors for AD. METHODS: Among 502,493 participants from the UK Biobank, baseline data were extracted for 4171 factors spanning 10 different categories. Phenome-wide association analyses and time-to-event analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with both polygenic risk scores for AD and AD diagnosis at follow-up. We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to further assess their potential causal relationships with AD and imaging association analysis to discover underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: We identified 39 factors significantly associated with both AD polygenic risk scores and risk of incident AD, where higher levels of education, body size, basal metabolic rate, fat-free mass, computer use, and cognitive functions were associated with a decreased risk of developing AD, and selective food intake and more outdoor exposures were associated with an increased risk of developing AD. The identified factors were also associated with AD-related brain structures, including the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and inferior/middle temporal cortex, and 21 of these factors were further supported by Mendelian randomization evidence. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively and rigorously assess the effects of wide-ranging risk factors on AD. Strong evidence was found for fat-free body mass, basal metabolic rate, computer use, selective food intake, and outdoor exposures as new risk factors for AD. Integration of genetic, clinical, and neuroimaging information may help prioritize risk factors and prevention targets for AD..

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hyperactive neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) (i.e., agitation, disinhibition, and irritability) are among the most challenging symptoms to manage in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, their underlying brain correlates have been poorly studied. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the associations between the total score of hyperactive NPS and brain structures in participants with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal older adults (CN). METHODS: Neuropsychiatric and 3T MRI data from 216 AD, 564 MCI, and 660 CN participants were extracted from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. To define NPS and brain structures' associations, we fitted a general linear model (GLM) in two ways: 1) an overall GLM including all three groups (AD, MCI, CN) and 2) three pair-wise GLMs (AD versus MCI, MCI versus CN, AD versus CN). The cortical changes as a function of NPS total score were investigated using multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: Results from the overall GLM include associations between 1) agitation and the right parietal supramarginal surface area in the MCI-CN contrast, 2) disinhibition and the cortical thickness of the right frontal pars opercularis and temporal inferior in the AD-MCI contrast, and 3) irritability and the right frontal pars opercularis, frontal superior, and temporal superior volumes in the MCI-CN contrast. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that each hyperactive NPS is associated with distinct brain regions in AD, MCI, and CN (groups with different levels of cognitive performance). This suggests that each NPS is associated with a unique signature of brain morphology, including variations in volume, thickness, or area..

2025-03-04 06:32:07,301 - INFO - Error in parsing the instance Title: Associations Between Hyperactive Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Brain Morphology in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hyperactive neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) (i.e., agitation, disinhibition, and irritability) are among the most challenging symptoms to manage in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, their underlying brain correlates have been poorly studied. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the associations between the total score of hyperactive NPS and brain structures in participants with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal older adults (CN). METHODS: Neuropsychiatric and 3T MRI data from 216 AD, 564 MCI, and 660 CN participants were extracted from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. To define NPS and brain structures' associations, we fitted a general linear model (GLM) in two ways: 1) an overall GLM including all three groups (AD, MCI, CN) and 2) three pair-wise GLMs (AD versus MCI, MCI versus CN, AD versus CN). The cortical changes as a function of NPS total score were investigated using multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: Results from the overall GLM include associations between 1) agitation and the right parietal supramarginal surface area in the MCI-CN contrast, 2) disinhibition and the cortical thickness of the right frontal pars opercularis and temporal inferior in the AD-MCI contrast, and 3) irritability and the right frontal pars opercularis, frontal superior, and temporal superior volumes in the MCI-CN contrast. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that each hyperactive NPS is associated with distinct brain regions in AD, MCI, and CN (groups with different levels of cognitive performance). This suggests that each NPS is associated with a unique signature of brain morphology, including variations in volume, thickness, or area..

2025-03-04 06:32:54,490 - INFO - Error in parsing the instance Title: Alzheimer's disease/dementia-associated brain pathology in aging DPP6-KO mice. Abstract: We have previously reported that the single transmembrane protein Dipeptidyl Peptidase Like 6 (DPP6) impacts neuronal and synaptic development. DPP6-KO mice are impaired in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory and exhibit smaller brain size. Recently, we have described novel structures in hippocampal area CA1 in aging mice, apparently derived from degenerating presynaptic terminals, that are significantly more prevalent in DPP6-KO mice compared to WT mice of the same age and that these structures were observed earlier in development in DPP6-KO mice. These novel structures appear as clusters of large puncta that colocalize NeuN, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A, and also partially label for MAP2, amyloid beta, APP, alpha-synuclein, and phosphorylated tau, with synapsin-1 and VGluT1 labeling on their periphery. In this current study, using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, we confirm that both APP and amyloid beta are prevalent in these structures; and we show with immunofluorescence the presence of similar structures in humans with Alzheimer's disease. Here we also found evidence that aging DPP6-KO mutants show additional changes related to Alzheimer's disease. We used in vivo MRI to show reduced size of the DPP6-KO brain and hippocampus. Aging DPP6-KO hippocampi contained fewer total neurons and greater neuron death and had diagnostic biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease present including accumulation of amyloid beta and APP and increase in expression of hyper-phosphorylated tau. The amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau pathologies were associated with neuroinflammation characterized by increases in microglia and astrocytes. And levels of proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines increased in aging DPP6-KO mice. We finally show that aging DPP6-KO mice display circadian dysfunction, a common symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Together these results indicate that aging DPP6-KO mice show symptoms of enhanced neurodegeneration reminiscent of dementia associated with a novel structure resulting from synapse loss and neuronal death. This study continues our laboratory's work in discerning the function of DPP6 and here provides compelling evidence of a direct role of DPP6 in Alzheimer's disease..

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now ranked as the third leading cause of death after heart disease and cancer. There is no definite cure for AD due to the multi-factorial nature of the disease, hence, multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) have attracted lots of attention. In this work, focusing on the efficient cholinesterase inhibitory activity of tacrine, design and synthesis of novel arylisoxazole-tacrine analogues was developed. In vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition assay confirmed high potency of the title compounds. Among them, compounds 7l and 7b demonstrated high activity toward AChE and BChE with IC50 values of 0.050 and 0.039 muM, respectively. Both compounds showed very good self-induced Abeta aggregation and AChE-induced inhibitory activity (79.4 and 71.4% for compound 7l and 61.8 and 58.6% for compound 7b, respectively). Also, 7l showed good anti-BACE1 activity with IC50 value of 1.65 microM. The metal chelation test indicated the ability of compounds 7l and 7b to chelate biometals (Zn2+, Cu2+, and Fe2+). However, they showed no significant neuroprotectivity against Abeta-induced damage in PC12 cells. Evaluation of in vitro hepatotoxicity revealed comparable toxicity of compounds 7l and 7b with tacrine. In vivo studies by Morris water maze (MWM) task demonstrated that compound 7l significantly reversed scopolamine-induced memory deficit in rats. Finally, molecular docking studies of compounds 7l and 7b confirmed establishment of desired interactions with the AChE, BChE, and BACE1 active sites.."}}]}

Abstract: Overexpression of the longevity gene Klotho prolongs, while its knockout shortens lifespan and impairs cognition via altered fibroblast growth factor signaling that perturbs myelination and synapse formation; however, comprehensive analysis of Klotho's knockout consequences on mammalian brain transcriptomics is lacking. Here, we report the altered levels under Klotho knockout of 1059 long RNAs, 27 microRNAs (miRs) and 6 tRNA fragments (tRFs), reflecting effects upon aging and cognition. Perturbed transcripts included key neuronal and glial pathway regulators that are notably changed in murine models of aging and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and in corresponding human post-mortem brain tissue. To seek cell type distributions of the affected short RNAs, we isolated and FACS-sorted neurons and microglia from live human brain tissue, yielding detailed cell type-specific short RNA-seq datasets. Together, our findings revealed multiple Klotho deficiency-perturbed aging- and neurodegeneration-related long and short RNA transcripts in both neurons and glia from murine and human brain.."}}]}

Abstract: We focused on investigating the effects and mechanisms of polystyrene (PS) microplastics in Alzheimer's disease (AD). PS could promote the cognitive impairment in mice and antagonize the action of PS. Meanwhile, it could promote microglial pyroptosis and aggravate neuroinflammation. In vitro results also showed that PS induced pyroptosis of BV2 and RAW264.7, after GSDMD silencing, such pyroptosis was inhibited. Our study found that PS aggravated neuroinflammation by inducing microglial pyroptosis, thereby promoting the progression of cognitive impairment in AD. This finding offers new support and reference for the induction of AD progression by environmental factors.."}}]}

2025-03-04 06:37:35,313 - INFO - Error in parsing the instance Title: Association of Cholinergic Basal Forebrain Volume and Functional Connectivity with Markers of Inflammatory Response in the Alzheimer's Disease Spectrum. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Inflammation has been described as a key pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD), downstream of amyloid and tau pathology. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that the cholinergic basal forebrain may moderate inflammatory response to different pathologies. OBJECTIVE: To study the association of cholinergic basal forebrain volume and functional connectivity with measures of neuroinflammation in people from the AD spectrum. METHODS: We studied 261 cases from the DELCODE cohort, including people with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, AD dementia, first degree relatives, and healthy controls. Using Bayesian ANCOVA, we tested associations of MRI indices of cholinergic basal forebrain volume and functional connectivity with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of sTREM2 as a marker of microglia activation, and serum levels of complement C3. Using Bayesian elastic net regression, we determined associations between basal forebrain measures and a large inflammation marker panel from CSF and serum. RESULTS: We found anecdotal to moderate evidence in favor of the absence of an effect of basal forebrain volume and functional connectivity on CSF sTREM2 and serum C3 levels both in Abeta42/ptau-positive and negative cases. Bayesian elastic net regression identified several CSF and serum markers of inflammation that were associated with basal forebrain volume and functional connectivity. The effect sizes were moderate to small. CONCLUSION: Our data-driven analyses generate the hypothesis that cholinergic basal forebrain may be involved in the neuroinflammation response to Abeta42 and phospho-tau pathology in people from the AD spectrum. This hypothesis needs to be tested in independent samples..

2025-03-04 06:38:18,165 - INFO - Error in parsing the instance Title: Isoform-specific dysregulation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling in a non-human primate model of Alzheimer's disease. Abstract: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a molecular sensor that is critical for the maintenance of cellular energy homeostasis, disruption of which has been indicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mammalian AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex and its enzymatic alpha subunit exists in two isoforms: AMPKalpha1 and AMPKalpha2. Here we took advantage of a recently characterized non-human primate (NHP) model with sporadic AD-like neuropathology to explore potential relationships between AMPK signaling and AD-like neuropathology. Subjects were nine female vervet monkeys aged 19.5 to 23.4 years old. Subjects were classified into three groups, control lacking AD pathology (n = 3), moderate AD pathology (n = 3), and more severe AD Pathology (n = 3). We found increased activity (assessed by phosphorylation) of AMPKalpha2 in hippocampi of NHP with AD-like neuropathology, compared to the subjects without AD pathology, with no alterations of AMPKalpha1 activity. Across all subjects, CSF Abeta42 was inversely associated with cerebral amyloid plaque density. Further, Abeta plaque burden is correlated with levels of either soluble or insoluble brain Abeta measurement. Unbiased mass spectrometry based proteomics studies combined with bioinformatics analysis revealed that many of the dysregulated proteins characteristic of AD neuropathology are associated with AMPK signaling. Our findings on the AMPK molecular signaling cascades provide further support for use of the NHP model to investigate new therapeutic strategies and development of novel biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease..

Abstract: The most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an intronic hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene. In disease, RNA transcripts containing this expanded region undergo repeat-associated non-AUG translation to produce dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), which are detected in brain and spinal cord of patients and are neurotoxic both in vitro and in vivo paradigms. We reveal here a novel pathogenic mechanism for the most abundantly detected DPR in ALS/FTD autopsy tissues, poly-glycine-alanine (GA). Previously, we showed motor dysfunction in a GA mouse model without loss of motor neurons. Here, we demonstrate that mobile GA aggregates are present within neurites, evoke a reduction in synaptic vesicle-associated protein 2 (SV2), and alter Ca2+ influx and synaptic vesicle release. These phenotypes could be corrected by restoring SV2 levels. In GA mice, loss of SV2 was observed without reduction of motor neuron number. Notably, reduction in SV2 was seen in cortical and motor neurons derived from patient induced pluripotent stem cell lines, suggesting synaptic alterations also occur in patients..'}}]}

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequently occurring primary brain tumor and has a very poor prognosis, with only around 5% of patients surviving for a period of 5 years or more after diagnosis. Despite aggressive multimodal therapy, consisting mostly of a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy, tumors nearly always recur close to the site of resection. For the past 15 years, very little progress has been made with regards to improving patient survival. Although immunotherapy represents an attractive therapy modality due to the promising pre-clinical results observed, many of these potential immunotherapeutic approaches fail during clinical trials, and to date no immunotherapeutic treatments for GBM have been approved. As for many other difficult to treat cancers, GBM combines a lack of immunogenicity with few mutations and a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Unfortunately, both tumor and immune cells have been shown to contribute towards this immunosuppressive phenotype. In addition, current therapeutics also exacerbate this immunosuppression which might explain the failure of immunotherapy-based clinical trials in the GBM setting. Understanding how these mechanisms interact with one another, as well as how one can increase the anti-tumor immune response by addressing local immunosuppression will lead to better clinical results for immune-based therapeutics. Improving therapeutic delivery across the blood brain barrier also presents a challenge for immunotherapy and future therapies will need to consider this. This review highlights the immunosuppressive mechanisms employed by GBM cancers and examines potential immunotherapeutic treatments that can overcome these significant immunosuppressive hurdles..

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequently occurring primary brain tumor and has a very poor prognosis, with only around 5% of patients surviving for a period of 5 years or more after diagnosis. Despite aggressive multimodal therapy, consisting mostly of a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy, tumors nearly always recur close to the site of resection. For the past 15 years, very little progress has been made with regards to improving patient survival. Although immunotherapy represents an attractive therapy modality due to the promising pre-clinical results observed, many of these potential immunotherapeutic approaches fail during clinical trials, and to date no immunotherapeutic treatments for GBM have been approved. As for many other difficult to treat cancers, GBM combines a lack of immunogenicity with few mutations and a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Unfortunately, both tumor and immune cells have been shown to contribute towards this immunosuppressive phenotype. In addition, current therapeutics also exacerbate this immunosuppression which might explain the failure of immunotherapy-based clinical trials in the GBM setting. Understanding how these mechanisms interact with one another, as well as how one can increase the anti-tumor immune response by addressing local immunosuppression will lead to better clinical results for immune-based therapeutics. Improving therapeutic delivery across the blood brain barrier also presents a challenge for immunotherapy and future therapies will need to consider this. This review highlights the immunosuppressive mechanisms employed by GBM cancers and examines potential immunotherapeutic treatments that can overcome these significant immunosuppressive hurdles..'}}]}

Abstract: Obesity is a pediatric epidemic that is more prevalent in children with developmental disabilities. We hypothesize that soy protein-based diets increase weight gain and alter neurobehavioral outcomes. Our objective herein was to test matched casein- and soy protein-based purified ingredient diets in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome, Fmr1KO mice. The experimental methods included assessment of growth; 24-7 activity levels; motor coordination; learning and memory; blood-based amino acid, phytoestrogen and glucose levels; and organ weights. The primary outcome measure was body weight. We find increased body weight in male Fmr1KO from postnatal day 6 (P6) to P224, male wild type (WT) from P32-P39, female Fmr1KO from P6-P18 and P168-P224, and female Fmr1HET from P9-P18 as a function of soy. Activity at the beginning of the light and dark cycles increased in female Fmr1HET and Fmr1KO mice fed soy. We did not find significant differences in rotarod or passive avoidance behavior as a function of genotype or diet. Several blood-based amino acids and phytoestrogens were significantly altered in response to soy. Liver weight was increased in WT and adipose tissue in Fmr1KO mice fed soy. Activity levels at the beginning of the light cycle and testes weight were greater in Fmr1KO versus WT males irrespective of diet. DEXA analysis at 8-months-old indicated increased fat mass and total body area in Fmr1KO females and lean mass and bone mineral density in Fmr1KO males fed soy. Overall, dietary consumption of soy protein isolate by C57BL/6J mice caused increased growth, which could be attributed to increased lean mass in males and fat mass in females. There were sex-specific differences with more pronounced effects in Fmr1KO versus WT and in males versus females..'}}]}

Abstract: Optineurin (OPTN) mutations are linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and normal tension glaucoma (NTG), but a relevant animal model is lacking, and the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration are unknown. We found that OPTN C-terminus truncation (OPTN C) causes late-onset neurodegeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), optic nerve (ON), and spinal cord motor neurons, preceded by a striking decrease of axonal mitochondria. Surprisingly, we discover that OPTN directly interacts with both microtubules and the mitochondrial transport complex TRAK1/KIF5B, stabilizing them for proper anterograde axonal mitochondrial transport, in a C-terminus dependent manner. Encouragingly, overexpressing OPTN/TRAK1/KIF5B reverses not only OPTN truncation-induced, but also ocular hypertension-induced neurodegeneration, and promotes striking ON regeneration. Therefore, in addition to generating new animal models for NTG and ALS, our results establish OPTN as a novel facilitator of the microtubule-dependent mitochondrial transport necessary for adequate axonal mitochondria delivery, and its loss as the likely molecular mechanism of neurodegeneration..'}}]}

Abstract: Compounds known to be successful in the treatment of alcohol use disorder include the aversive agent, Disulfiram, the glutamatergic NMDA receptor antagonist, Acamprosate, and the opioid receptor antagonists, Naltrexone and Nalmefene. Although all four are effective in maintaining abstinence or reduction of alcohol consumption, only a small percentage of patients receive pharmacological treatment. In addition, many other medications have been investigated for their therapeutic potential in the treatment of alcohol use disorder. In this review we summarize and compare Baclofen, Gabapentin, Topiramate, Ondansetron, Varenicline, Aripiprazole, Quetiapine, Clozapine, Antidepressants, Lithium, Neuropeptide Y, Neuropeptide S, Corticotropin-releasing factor antagonists, Oxytocin, PF-05190457, Memantine, Ifenprodil, Samidorphan, Ondelopran, ABT-436, SSR149415, Mifepristone, Ibudilast, Citicoline, Rimonabant, Surinabant, AM4113 and Gamma-hydroxybutyrate While some have shown promising results in the treatment of alcohol use disorder, others have disappointed and should be excluded from further investigation. Here we discuss the most promising results and highlight medications that deserve further preclinical or clinical study. Effective, patient-tailored treatment will require greater understanding provided by many more preclinical and clinical studies..'}}]}

2025-03-04 06:46:11,683 - INFO - Error in parsing the instance Title: Differential Sensitivity of the Protein Translation Initiation Machinery and mTOR Signaling to MECP2 Gain- and Loss-of-Function Involves MeCP2 Isoform-Specific Homeostasis in the Brain. Abstract: Eukaryotic gene expression is controlled at multiple levels, including gene transcription and protein translation initiation. One molecule with key roles in both regulatory mechanisms is methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). MECP2 gain- and loss-of-function mutations lead to Rett Syndrome and MECP2 Duplication Syndrome, respectively. To study MECP2 gain-of-function, we generated stably transduced human brain cells using lentiviral vectors for both MECP2E1 and MECP2E2 isoforms. Stable overexpression was confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. We assessed the impact of MeCP2E1-E2 gain-of-function on the MeCP2 homeostasis regulatory network (MECP2E1/E2-BDNF/BDNF-miR-132), mTOR-AKT signaling, ribosome biogenesis, markers of chromatin structure, and protein translation initiation. We observed that combined co-transduction of MeCP2 isoforms led to protein degradation of MeCP2E1. Proteosome inhibition by MG132 treatment recovered MeCP2E1 protein within an hour, suggesting its induced degradation through the proteosome pathway. No significant change was detected for translation initiation factors as a result of MeCP2E1, MeCP2E2, or combined overexpression of both isoforms. In contrast, analysis of human Rett Syndrome brains tissues compared with controls indicated impaired protein translation initiation, suggesting that such mechanisms may have differential sensitivity to MECP2 gain- and loss-of-function. Collectively, our results provide further insight towards the dose-dependent functional role of MeCP2 isoforms in the human brain..

2025-03-04 06:47:07,509 - INFO - Error in parsing the instance Title: FBXL17/spastin axis as a novel therapeutic target of hereditary spastic paraplegia. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Spastin significantly influences microtubule regulation in neurons and is implicated in the pathogenesis of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). However, post-translational regulation of the spastin protein remains nebulous. The association between E3 ubiquitin ligase and spastin provides a potential therapeutic strategy. RESULTS: As evidenced by protein chip analysis, FBXL17 inversely correlated with SPAST-M1 at the protein level in vitro and, also in vivo during embryonic developmental stage. SPAST-M1 protein interacted with FBXL17 specifically via the BTB domain at the N-terminus of SPAST-M1. The SCFFBXL17 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex degraded SPAST-M1 protein in the nuclear fraction in a proteasome-dependent manner. SPAST phosphorylation occurred only in the cytoplasmic fraction by CK2 and was involved in poly-ubiquitination. Inhibition of SCFFBXL17 E3 ubiquitin ligase by small chemical and FBXL17 shRNA decreased proteasome-dependent degradation of SPAST-M1 and induced axonal extension. The SPAST Y52C mutant, harboring abnormality in BTB domain could not interact with FBXL17, thereby escaping protein regulation by the SCFFBXL17 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, resulting in loss of functionality with aberrant quantity. Although this mutant showed shortening of axonal outgrowth, low rate proliferation, and poor differentiation capacity in a 3D model, this phenotype was rescued by inhibiting SCFFBXL17 E3 ubiquitin ligase. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered that a novel pathway, FBXL17-SPAST was involved in pathogenicity of HSP by the loss of function and the quantitative regulation. This result suggested that targeting FBXL17 could provide new insight into HSP therapeutics..

Abstract: The brain is a complex, multiscale dynamical system composed of many interacting regions. Knowledge of the spatiotemporal organization of these interactions is critical for establishing a solid understanding of the brain\'s functional architecture and the relationship between neural dynamics and cognition in health and disease. The possibility of studying these dynamics through careful analysis of neuroimaging data has catalyzed substantial interest in methods that estimate time-resolved fluctuations in functional connectivity (often referred to as "dynamic" or time-varying functional connectivity; TVFC). At the same time, debates have emerged regarding the application of TVFC analyses to resting fMRI data, and about the statistical validity, physiological origins, and cognitive and behavioral relevance of resting TVFC. These and other unresolved issues complicate interpretation of resting TVFC findings and limit the insights that can be gained from this promising new research area. This article brings together scientists with a variety of perspectives on resting TVFC to review the current literature in light of these issues. We introduce core concepts, define key terms, summarize controversies and open questions, and present a forward-looking perspective on how resting TVFC analyses can be rigorously and productively applied to investigate a wide range of questions in cognitive and systems neuroscience..'}}]}

Abstract: A series of novel hybrid chalcone N-ethyl-piperazinyl amide derivatives of oleanonic and ursonic acids were synthesized, and their cytotoxic potential was evaluated in vitro against the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel. Compounds 4 and 6 exhibited the highest overall anticancer activity, with GI50 values in some cases reaching nanomolar values. Thus, the two compounds were further assessed in detail in order to identify a possible apoptosis- and antiangiogenic-based mechanism of action induced by the assessed compounds. DAPI staining revealed that both compounds induced nuclei condensation and overall cell morphological changes consistent with apoptotic cell death. rtPCR analysis showed that up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bak gene combined with the down-regulation of the pro-survival Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 genes caused altered ratios between the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins' levels, leading to overall induced apoptosis. Molecular docking analysis revealed that both compounds exhibited high scores for Bcl-XL inhibition, suggesting that compounds may induce apoptotic cell death through targeted anti-apoptotic protein inhibition, as well. Ex vivo determinations showed that both compounds did not significantly alter the angiogenesis process on the tested cell lines.."}}]}

Abstract: Ion channels are present at specific levels within subcellular compartments of excitable cells. The regulation of ion channel trafficking and targeting is an effective way to control cell excitability. The BK channel is a calcium-activated potassium channel that serves as a negative feedback mechanism at presynaptic axon terminals and sites of muscle excitation. The C. elegans BK channel ortholog, SLO-1, requires an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein for efficient anterograde transport to these locations. Here, we found that, in the absence of this ER membrane protein, SLO-1 channels that are seemingly normally folded and expressed at physiological levels undergo SEL-11/HRD1-mediated ER-associated degradation (ERAD). This SLO-1 degradation is also indirectly regulated by a SKN-1A/NRF1-mediated transcriptional mechanism that controls proteasome levels. Therefore, our data indicate that SLO-1 channel density is regulated by the competitive balance between the efficiency of ER trafficking machinery and the capacity of ERAD..'}}]}

Abstract: The current challenge in clinical practice is to identify those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who are at greater risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) conversion in the near future. The aim of this study was to assess a clinically practical new hippocampal index-hippocampal volume normalized by cerebellar volume (hippocampus to cerebellum volume ratio) used alone or in combination with scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination, as a predictor of conversion from MCI to AD. The predictive value of the HCCR was also contrasted to that of the hippocampal volume to intracranial volume ratio. The findings revealed that the performance of the combination of measures was significantly better than that of each measure used individually. The combination of Mini-Mental State Examination and hippocampal volume, normalized by the cerebellum or by intracranial volume, accurately discriminated individuals with MCI who progress to AD within 5 years from other MCI types (stable, reverters) and those with intact cognition (area under receiver operating curve of 0.88 and 0.89, respectively). Normalization by cerebellar volume was as accurate as normalization by intracranial volume with the advantage of being more practical, particularly for serial assessments.."}}]}

Abstract: While accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposited as senile plaques is a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the neurotoxicity of these deposits remains controversial. Recent in vitro studies suggested a link between elevated Abeta and mitochondrial dysfunction that might contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. However, the in vivo evidence for mitochondria dysfunction caused by Abeta is still missing. Using intravital multiphoton imaging with a range of fluorescent markers, we systematically surveyed mitochondrial structural and functional changes in AD mouse models. We observed severe impairments to be limited to the vicinity of Abeta plaques, which included reduction of both numbers and membrane potential of mitochondria and the emergence of dystrophic and fragmented mitochondria. Both neuronal soma and neurites with oxidative stress show severe alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential in amyloid precursor protein mice. These results provide in vivo evidence revealing Abeta plaques as focal sources of toxicity that lead to severe structural and functional abnormalities in mitochondria. These alterations may contribute to neuronal network dysfunction and warrant further investigation as possible targets for therapeutic intervention in AD.."}}]}

Abstract: In this study, we used MRI to analyze quantitative parametric maps of transverse (T(2)) relaxation times in a longitudinal study of transgenic mice expressing mutant forms of amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin (PS1), or both (PS/APP), modeling aspects of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main goal was to characterize the effects of progressive beta-amyloid accumulation and deposition on the biophysical environment of water and to investigate if these measurements would provide early indirect evidence of AD pathological changes in the brains of these mice. Our results demonstrate that at an early age before beta-amyloid deposition, only PS/APP mice show a reduced T(2) in the hippocampus and cortex compared with wild-type non-transgenic (NTg) controls, whereas a statistically significant within-group aging-associated decrease in T(2) values is seen in the cortex and hippocampus of all three transgenic genotypes (APP, PS/APP, and PS) but not in the NTg controls. In addition, for animals older than 12 months, we confirmed our previous report that only the two genotypes that form amyloid plaques (APP and PS/APP) have significantly reduced T(2) values compared with NTg controls. Thus, T(2) changes in these AD models can precede amyloid deposition or even occur in AD models that do not deposit beta-amyloid (PS mice), but are intensified in the presence of amyloid deposition..

The main goal was to characterize the effects of progressive beta-amyloid accumulation and deposition on the biophysical environment of water and to investigate if these measurements would provide early indirect evidence of AD pathological changes in the brains of these mice. Our results demonstrate that at an early age before beta-amyloid deposition, only PS/APP mice show a reduced T(2) in the hippocampus and cortex compared with wild-type non-transgenic (NTg) controls, whereas a statistically significant within-group aging-associated decrease in T(2) values is seen in the cortex and hippocampus of all three transgenic genotypes (APP, PS/APP, and PS) but not in the NTg controls. In addition, for animals older than 12 months, we confirmed our previous report that only the two genotypes that form amyloid plaques (APP and PS/APP) have significantly reduced T(2) values compared with NTg controls. Thus, T(2) changes in these AD models can precede amyloid deposition or even occur in AD models that do not deposit beta-amyloid (PS mice), but are intensified in the presence of amyloid deposition..

Abstract: The endocannabinoid system has gained much attention as a new potential pharmacotherapeutic target in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the association between CB1 alterations and the development of AD neuropathology is unclear and often contradictory. In this study, brain CB1 mRNA and CB1 protein levels were analyzed in 3 x Tg-AD mice and compared to wild-type littermates at 2, 6 and 12 months of age, using in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Semiquantitative analysis of CB1 expression focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), prelimbic cortex, dorsal hippocampus (DH), basolateral amygdala complex (BLA), and ventral hippocampus (VH), all areas with high CB1 densities that are strongly affected by neuropathology in 3 x Tg-AD mice. At 2 months of age, there was no change in CB1 mRNA and protein levels in 3 x Tg-AD mice compared to Non-Tg mice in all brain areas analyzed. However, at 6 and 12 months of age, CB1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in PFC, DH, and BLA, and lower in VH in 3 x Tg-AD mice compared to wild-type littermates. CB1 immunohistochemistry revealed that CB1 protein expression was unchanged in 3 x Tg-AD at 2 and 6 months of age, while a significant decrease in CB1 receptor immunoreactivity was detected in the BLA and DH of 12-month-old 3 x Tg-AD mice, with no sign of alteration in other brain areas. The altered CB1 levels appear, rather, to be age-and/or pathology-dependent, indicating an involvement of the endocannabinoid system in AD pathology and supporting the ECS as a potential novel therapeutic target for treatment of AD.."}}]}

2025-03-04 06:53:27,914 - INFO - Error in parsing the instance Title: Do epigenetic pathways initiate late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD): towards a new paradigm. Abstract: Late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a non-familial, progressive neurodegenerative disease and the most prominent form of dementia in the elderly. Accumulating evidence suggests that LOAD not only results from the combined effects of variation in a number of genes and environmental factors, but also from epigenetic abnormalities such as histone modifications or DNA methylation. In comparison to monogenic diseases, LOAD exhibits numerous anomalies that suggest an epigenetic component in disease etiology. Evidence against a monogenic course and for an epigenetic component include: 1) the dominance of sporadic cases over familial ones and the low estimated concordance rates for monozygotic twins; 2) gender specific susceptibility and course of disease; 3) parent-of-origin effects, and late age of onset; 4) brain chromatin abnormalities, non-Mendelian inheritance patterns, and atypical levels of folate and homocysteine; and 5) monoallelic expression patterns of susceptibility genes [1]. The epigenome is particularly susceptible to deregulation during early embryonic and neonatal periods and thus disturbances during these periods can have latent lasting effects. The Latent Early-life Associated Regulation (LEARn) model attempts to explain these consequences from a brain specific point of view. In the present review we present the evidence that support the role of epigenetics in the development of AD and explore the potential pathways and mechanisms that may be involved..

Abstract: Late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a non-familial, progressive neurodegenerative disease and the most prominent form of dementia in the elderly. Accumulating evidence suggests that LOAD not only results from the combined effects of variation in a number of genes and environmental factors, but also from epigenetic abnormalities such as histone modifications or DNA methylation. In comparison to monogenic diseases, LOAD exhibits numerous anomalies that suggest an epigenetic component in disease etiology. Evidence against a monogenic course and for an epigenetic component include: 1) the dominance of sporadic cases over familial ones and the low estimated concordance rates for monozygotic twins; 2) gender specific susceptibility and course of disease; 3) parent-of-origin effects, and late age of onset; 4) brain chromatin abnormalities, non-Mendelian inheritance patterns, and atypical levels of folate and homocysteine; and 5) monoallelic expression patterns of susceptibility genes [1]. The epigenome is particularly susceptible to deregulation during early embryonic and neonatal periods and thus disturbances during these periods can have latent lasting effects. The Latent Early-life Associated Regulation (LEARn) model attempts to explain these consequences from a brain specific point of view. In the present review we present the evidence that support the role of epigenetics in the development of AD and explore the potential pathways and mechanisms that may be involved.."}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIMS: Factors including rate of disease progression, different aspects of cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) treatment, and use of community-based services might affect the longitudinal outcome of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whether these factors alter life expectancy in AD is unclear. We therefore examined the association between long-term ChEI therapy and survival. METHODS: The present study included 1,021 patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD and a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 10-26 at baseline from a 3-year, prospective, multicenter study of ChEI therapy in clinical practice. The relationship of potential predictors with mortality was analyzed using Cox regression models. RESULTS: After up to 16 years of follow-up, 841 (82%) of the participants had died. In the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale, a mean decline of >= 4 points/year or >= 2 points/year on the Physical Self-Maintenance Scale was a risk factor for an earlier death. In the multivariate models, longer survival was associated with higher ChEI dose and longer duration of treatment. Users of community-based services at baseline exhibited a 1-year shorter mean life expectancy than nonusers. CONCLUSION: A longer survival time can be anticipated for AD patients with slower deterioration who receive and tolerate higher ChEI doses and a longer duration of treatment.."}}]}

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The influence of vascular risk factors (VRFs) on the rate of cognitive decline in patients with established dementia is unclear. This study aims to examine the association between VRFs and the rate of cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Data were obtained from patients visiting a memory clinic between 2004 and 2012. VRFs were determined at baseline and included hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, overweight and smoking. Continuous values of blood pressure, total cholesterol, glucose level and body mass index were also obtained. Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores were obtained at baseline and during follow-up visits. The association between VRFs and the annual change in MMSE scores was analysed with a multivariable linear mixed model adjusted for age, sex and the aforementioned VRFs. RESULTS: From 174 patients (mean age 78.3 years), with a follow-up time up to 5.8 years (mean 1.1 year), in total 447 MMSE scores were obtained. The multivariable analyses showed an association between age as well as systolic blood pressure and a decline in annual rates of change in MMSE scores of -0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.09 to 0.00) and -0.01 (CI: -0.03 to 0.00), respectively. For all other VRFs, including sex, patients did not show a significant difference. CONCLUSION: This study did not find an association between preventable vascular risk factors and cognitive decline in patients with AD, except for systolic blood pressure. As the association between systolic blood pressure and decline in MMSE was small, clinical relevance may be limited.."}}]}

Abstract: Synapse loss is crucially involved in cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study was performed to investigate the distribution and density of chromogranin B-like immunoreactivity in the hippocampus of control compared to AD brain. Chromogranin B is a large precursor molecule found in large dense-core vesicles. For immunocytochemistry we used an antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide (PE- 11) present in the chromogranin B molecule. Chromogranin B-like immunoreactivity was concentrated in the terminal field of mossy fibers, the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in layer II of the entorhinal cortex. In AD, chromogranin B was detected in neuritic plaques. The density of chromogranin B-like immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in layers II, III and V of the entorhinal cortex in AD brains. The present study demonstrates that chromogranin B is a marker for human hippocampal pathways. It is particularly suitable for studying nerve fibers terminating at the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. It is present in neuritic plaques, and its density is reduced in a layer-specific manner.."}}]}

Abstract: The relationship between neuritic plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease and cholinergic innervation of brain regions is unclear. Many neuritic plaques are found in the amygdala, which also receives dense cholinergic innervation from the ventral forebrain, predominantly to the basolateral complex. To determine whether the regional distribution of neuritic plaques is related to the pattern of cholinergic innervation, we studied serial sections through the amygdala of four patients with Alzheimer's disease and four neurologically normal patients. We compared acetylcholinesterase reactivity, neuritic plaques stained with thioflavine S, and cytoarchitectural features in adjacent sections. Neuritic plaque counts were high in most amygdaloid nuclei but were significantly lower in the most acetylcholinesterase-positive region, the lateral portion of the basal nucleus of the amygdala. Acetylcholinesterase reactivity was reduced in the Alzheimer's cases, but the basal nucleus was easily recognized by the characteristic large neurons. The morphology of neuritic plaques also differed in the various regions. These results show that neuritic plaques occur to varying degrees in all nuclei of the amygdala, but are significantly less frequent in the region that receives the most prominent innervation from the cholinergic ventral forebrain.."}}]}

The objective of this study is to analyze the association between exenatide use among Medicare beneficiaries with T2DM and the incidence of AD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis on claims data from a 20% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries with T2DM from 2007 to 2013 (n = 342,608). We compared rates of incident AD between 2009 and 2013 according to exenatide use in 2007-2008, measured by the number of 30-day-equivalent fills. We adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and use of other drugs. Unmeasured confounding was assessed with an instrumental variables approach. RESULTS: The sample was mostly female (65%), White (76%), and 74 years old on average. Exenatide users were more likely to be male (38% vs. 35%), White (87% vs. 76%), and younger (by 4.2 years) than non-users. Each additional 30-day-equivalent claim was associated with a 2.4% relative reduction in incidence (odds ratio 0.976; 95% confidence interval 0.963-0.989; P < .001). There was no evidence of unmeasured confounding. DISCUSSION: Exenatide use is associated with a reduced incidence of AD among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older with T2DM. The association shown in this study warrants consideration by clinicians prescribing insulin sensitizing agents to patients.."}}]}

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disease that is related to aging and is the leading cause of dementia globally. AD has a significant influence on cognitive functions, particularly memory, resulting in a variety of functional deficits. Given the increasing prevalence of AD, there is an urgent need for the development of effective therapeutic therapies. In a quest to uncover a holistic remedy for AD, a total of 41 bioactive compounds derived from three distinct medicinal plant sources were screened to evaluate their potential to inhibit the active sites of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The insilico screening protocol included 24 licorice-derived compounds, 5 ginkgo biloba-derived compounds, and 11 ginseng-derived compounds. Two compounds (Ginkgolide A and Licorice glycoside D2) were observed to display greater binding energy (BE) relative to the control by interacting with crucial residues in the active site of AChE. Ginkgolide A and Licorice glycoside D2 exhibited BEs of -11.3 and -11.2 kcal/mol, respectively, whereas the control, Donepezil, demonstrated a BE of -10.8 kcal/mol. Further, these compounds exhibit favorable drug-likeness properties. This study suggests that further experimental investigations can be conducted on Ginkgolide A and Licorice glycoside D2 to explore their potential therapeutic applications for AD.."}}]}

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, accounting for nearly 60% of all dementia cases. The occurrence of the disease has been increasing rapidly in recent years. Presently about 46.8 million individuals suffer from AD worldwide. The current absence of effective treatment to reverse or stop AD progression highlights the importance of disease prevention and early diagnosis. Brain structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been widely used for AD detection as it can display morphometric differences and cerebral structural changes. In this study, we built three machine learning-based MRI data classifiers to predict AD and infer the brain regions that contribute to disease development and progression. We then systematically compared the three distinct classifiers, which were constructed based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), 3D Very Deep Convolutional Network (VGGNet) and 3D Deep Residual Network (ResNet), respectively. To improve the performance of the deep learning classifiers, we applied a transfer learning strategy. The weights of a pre-trained model were transferred and adopted as the initial weights of our models. Transferring the learned features significantly reduced training time and increased network efficiency. The classification accuracy for AD subjects from elderly control subjects was 90%, 95%, and 95% for the SVM, VGGNet and ResNet classifiers, respectively. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was employed to show discriminative regions that contributed most to the AD classification by utilizing the learned spatial information of the 3D-VGGNet and 3D-ResNet models. The resulted maps consistently highlighted several disease-associated brain regions, particularly the cerebellum which is a relatively neglected brain region in the present AD study. Overall, our comparisons suggested that the ResNet model provided the best classification performance as well as more accurate localization of disease-associated regions in the brain compared to the other two approaches.."}}]}

Abstract: Several lines of evidence have established that proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons within the sub-granular zone of the dentate gyrus, a process named adult hippocampal neurogenesis, contribute to maintaining healthy cognitive functions throughout life. The rate of adult hippocampal neurogenesis decreases with aging and a premature impairment of adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been observed both in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and human post-mortem tissues. The causal relationship between adult hippocampal neurogenesis and the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology has, however, not been established. This is partly due to the limitation of recapitulating the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology in rodent models and the lack of translatable biomarkers to identify tractable targets in humans. While it is tempting to postulate that adult hippocampal neurogenesis could be leveraged to improve cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease, consensual results have yet to be reached to fully explore this hypothesis. In this review, we discuss how the recent progress in identifying molecular pathways in adult hippocampal neurogenesis provides a good framework to initiate strategies for drug-based intervention in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in Alzheimer's disease. We outline how discrepancies in pre-clinical disease models and experimental methodology have resulted in contradictory findings and propose a shift towards using more translatable approaches to model neurogenesis in Alzheimer's disease. In particular, we review how exploring novel experimental paradigms including the use of human induced pluripotent stem cells and more complex cell culture systems, as well as standardizing protocols used to investigate evidence of neurogenesis in human tissues, could deliver deeper mechanistic insights that would kick-start innovative drug discovery efforts to promote healthy aging and cellular rejuvenation..

Abstract: Astrocyte reactivity is a hallmark of neuroinflammation that arises with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and nearly every other neurodegenerative condition. While astrocytes certainly contribute to classic inflammatory processes (e.g. cytokine release, waste clearance, and tissue repair), newly emerging technologies for measuring and targeting cell specific activities in the brain have uncovered essential roles for astrocytes in synapse function, brain metabolism, neurovascular coupling, and sleep/wake patterns. In this review, we use a holistic approach to incorporate, and expand upon, classic neuroinflammatory concepts to consider how astrocyte dysfunction/reactivity modulates multiple pathological and clinical hallmarks of AD. Our ever-evolving understanding of astrocyte signaling in neurodegeneration is not only revealing new drug targets and treatments for dementia but is suggesting we reimagine AD pathophysiological mechanisms.."}}]}

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) proposed outcome measures for clinical trials on Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the Therapeutic Area User Guide for AD (TAUG-AD). To investigate how well the clinical trials on AD registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov complied with the recommendations on outcome measures by the CDISC. METHODS: We compared the outcome measures proposed in the TAUG-AD version 2.0.1 with those employed in the protocols of clinical trials on AD registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. RESULTS: We analyzed 101 outcome measures from 305 protocols. The TAUG-AD listed ten scales for outcome measures of clinical trials on AD. The scales for cognition, activities of daily living, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and global severity listed in TAUG-AD were most frequently employed in the clinical trials on AD. However, TAUG-AD did not include any scale on quality of life. Also, several scales such as Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living, and Cohen- Mansfield Agitation Inventory not listed in the TAUG-AD were commonly employed in the clinical trials on AD and changed over time. CONCLUSION: To properly standardize the data from clinical trials on AD, the gap between the TAUG-AD and the measures employed in real-world clinical trials should be filled.."}}]}

Abstract: Iron is an essential transition metal for numerous biologic processes in mammals. Iron metabolism is regulated via several coordination mechanisms including absorption, utilization, recycling, and storage. Iron dyshomeostasis can result in intracellular iron retention, thereby damaging cells, tissues, and organs through free oxygen radical generation. Numerous studies have shown that brain iron overload is involved in the pathological mechanism of neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Ferroptosis, a newly defined iron-dependent form of cell death, which is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy, and other forms of cell death, may provide us a new viewpoint. Here, we set out to summarize the current knowledge of iron metabolism and ferroptosis, and review the contributions of iron and ferroptosis to AD.."}}]}

Abstract: The amyloid cascade hypothesis is a useful framework for therapeutic development in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid b1-42 (Abeta) has been the main target of experimental therapies, based on evidence of the neurotoxic effects of Abeta, and of the potential adverse effects of brain Abeta burden detected in humans in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET). Progress on passive anti-amyloid immunotherapy research includes identification of antibodies that facilitate microglial activation, catalytical disaggregation, and increased flow of Abeta from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to plasma, thus decreasing the neurotoxic effects of Abeta. Recently completed phase 2 and 3 trials of 3rd generation anti-amyloid immunotherapies are supportive of their clinical efficacy in reducing brain Abeta burden and preventing cognitive decline. Data from recent trials implicate these agents as the first effective disease-modifying therapies against AD and has led to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recent approval of aducanumab and lecanemab, under an accelerated approval pathway. The clinical effects of these agents are modest, however, and associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Testing the effects of anti-Abeta immunotherapies in pre-symptomatic populations and identification of more potent and safer agents is the scope of ongoing and future research. Innovations in clinical trial design will be the key for the efficient and equitable development of novel anti-Abeta immunotherapies. The progress in the field of AD therapeutics will bring new clinical, logistical, and ethical challenges, which pose to revolutionize the practice of neurology, dementia care, and preventive cognitive healthcare.."}}]}

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive impairment and memory loss, for which there is no effective cure to date. In the past several years, numerous studies have shown that increased inflammation in AD is a major cause of cognitive impairment. This study aimed to reveal 22 kinds of peripheral immune cell types and key genes associated with AD. The prefrontal cortex transcriptomic data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were collected, and CIBERSORT was used to assess the composition of 22 kinds of immune cells in all samples. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to construct gene co-expression networks and identified candidate module genes associated with AD. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and random forest (RF) models were constructed to analyze candidate module genes, which were selected from the result of WGCNA. The results showed that the immune infiltration in the prefrontal cortex of AD patients was different from healthy samples. Of all 22 kinds of immune cells, M1 macrophages were the most relevant cell type to AD. We revealed 10 key genes associated with AD and M1 macrophages by LASSO and RF analysis, including ARMCX5, EDN3, GPR174, MRPL23, RAET1E, ROD1, TRAF1, WNT7B, OR4K2 and ZNF543. We verified these 10 genes by logistic regression and k-fold cross-validation. We also validated the key genes in an independent dataset, and found GPR174, TRAF1, ROD1, RAET1E, OR4K2, MRPL23, ARMCX5 and EDN3 were significantly different between the AD and healthy controls. Moreover, in the 5XFAD transgenic mice, the differential expression trends of Wnt7b, Gpr174, Ptbp3, Mrpl23, Armcx5 and Raet1e are consistent with them in independent dataset. Our results provided potential therapeutic targets for AD patients.."}}]}

2025-03-04 07:02:02,629 - INFO - Error in parsing the instance Title: Preclinical evidence of Alzheimer's disease in persons homozygous for the epsilon 4 allele for apolipoprotein E. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Variants of the apolipoprotein E allele appear to account for most cases of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and persons with two copies of the epsilon 4 allele appear to have an especially high risk of dementia. Positron-emission tomography (PET) has identified specific regions of the brain in which the rate of glucose metabolism declines progressively in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease. We used PET to investigate whether these same regions of the brain are affected in subjects homozygous for the epsilon 4 allele before the onset of cognitive impairment. METHODS: Apolipoprotein E genotypes were established in 235 volunteers 50 to 65 years of age who reported a family history of probable Alzheimer's disease. Neurologic and psychiatric evaluations, a battery of neuropsychological tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and PET were performed in 11 epsilon 4 homozygotes and 22 controls without the epsilon 4 allele who were matched for sex, age, and level of education. An automated method was used to generate an aggregate surface-projection map that compared regional rates of glucose metabolism in the two groups. RESULTS: The epsilon 4 homozygotes were cognitively normal. They had significantly reduced rates of glucose metabolism in the same posterior cingulate, parietal, temporal, and prefrontal regions as in previously studied patients with probable Alzheimer's disease. They also had reduced rates of glucose metabolism in additional prefrontal regions, which may be preferentially affected during normal aging. CONCLUSIONS: In late middle age, cognitively normal subjects who are homozygous for the epsilon 4 allele for apolipoprotein E have reduced glucose metabolism in the same regions of the brain as in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease. These findings provide preclinical evidence that the presence of the epsilon 4 allele is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. PET may offer a relatively rapid way of testing future treatments to prevent Alzheimer's disease..

Abstract: The presence of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-amyloid protein (beta A4) was investigated in the cerebra of 4 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 1 patient with Down's syndrome, 4 patients with dementia of the Lewy body type (DLB) and 4 age-matched, clinically nondemented controls, of which one displayed many amyloid plaques. The different types of amyloid plaques stained strongly with antibodies against beta A4. Antibodies against the C-terminal region of APP reacted only weakly with small swollen neurites and with globular deposits in neuritic-type plaques from patients with AD. The antibody against the N-terminal region of APP stained strongly cellular elements in the neuritic type plaques of patients with AD but not dense cored plaques. In contrast, patients with DLB displayed with this antibody a homogeneous staining of dense cored amyloid plaques. Some Lewy bodies stained with the antibody against the N-terminal region of APP as well. These results indicate that the processing of APP in AD and DLB could be different, to yield different fragments deposited in AD and DLB amyloid plaques.."}}]}

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Oxidative stress (OS), is defined as an imbalance of pro- and antioxidants, leading to increased production of free radicals, which can lead to cell damage and death, has been postulated as important factors in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most research has concentrated on the antioxidant system, for the first time, this proof of concept study examines the prooxidant system by investigating kinetic parameters of the free radical producing enzyme xanthine oxidase directly in post mortem brain tissue. METHODS: We determined the Michaelis-Menten constant (K(M)) and the maximal velocity (V(Max)) of xanthine oxidase (XO) in the cortico-limbic system of patients with AD using activity assays. RESULTS: We found the Michaelis-Menton constant of XO significantly decreased in hippocampus of patients with AD compared to controls. None of the other brain regions showed any significant alterations of these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: These results add further evidence to the amount of research indicating that OS plays an important role in AD. Moreover, these results should encourage more research in this field and it maybe speculated that this might open new avenues for treatment and prevention in AD.."}}]}

2025-03-04 07:03:56,369 - INFO - Error in parsing the instance Title: Genome scan in familial late-onset Alzheimer's disease: a locus on chromosome 6 contributes to age-at-onset. Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, genetically complex, fatal neurodegenerative disorder of late life. Although several genes are known to play a role in early-onset AD, identification of the genetic basis of late onset AD (LOAD) has been challenging, with only the APOE gene known to have a high contribution to both AD risk and age-at-onset. Here, we present the first genome-scan analysis of the complete, well-characterized University of Washington LOAD sample of 119 pedigrees, using age-at-onset as the trait of interest. The analysis approach used allows for a multilocus trait model while at the same time accommodating age censoring, effects of APOE as a known genetic covariate, and full pedigree and marker information. The results provide strong evidence for linkage of loci contributing to age-at-onset to genomic regions on chromosome 6q16.3, and to 19q13.42 in the region of the APOE locus. There was evidence for interaction between APOE and the locus on chromosome 6q and suggestive evidence for linkage to chromosomes 11p13, 15q12-14, and 19p13.12. These results provide the first independent confirmation of an AD age-at-onset locus on chromosome 6 and suggest that further efforts towards identifying the underlying causal locus or loci are warranted..

The results provide strong evidence for linkage of loci contributing to age-at-onset to genomic regions on chromosome 6q16.3, and to 19q13.42 in the region of the APOE locus. There was evidence for interaction between APOE and the locus on chromosome 6q and suggestive evidence for linkage to chromosomes 11p13, 15q12-14, and 19p13.12. These results provide the first independent confirmation of an AD age-at-onset locus on chromosome 6 and suggest that further efforts towards identifying the underlying causal locus or loci are warranted..

Abstract: As the initial step in a systematic genome survey, 16 simple sequence tandem repeat polymorphisms that span the X chromosome at an average spacing of 10 cM were examined for allelic associations with typical-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). The efficiency of this survey was substantially enhanced by genotyping pools of genomic DNA from 50 autopsy-confirmed AD cases and 50 autopsied controls who were similar in sex ratio, race, and age at death. The frequency of the DXS1047 202-bp allele was twice as common among AD cases (0.45+/-S.E. 0.06) than controls (0.22+/-S.E. 0.05), a finding that was reproduced in an independent and geographically disparate sample. Consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the proportion of women with AD who carried the 202-bp allele, 73% was nearly double that observed for men with AD, 38%. However, the frequency of the 202-bp allele was similar for men and women and the presence of this allele did not affect the age at onset of dementia in either sex. Furthermore, the frequency of the DXS1047 202-bp allele in AD cases and controls was unaffected by the APOE genotype, indicating that these two loci modulate AD risk independently. Finally, the frequency of the 202-bp allele among 50 autopsy-confirmed cases of Parkinson's disease (0.29+/-S.E. 0.06) was indistinguishable from the control value, reflecting relative specificity for this allelic association with AD.."}}]}

Abstract: The Abeta peptide is the major protein component of amyloid deposits in Alzheimer\'s disease (AD). Age-related microenvironmental changes in the AD brain promote amyloid formation that leads to cell injury and death. Altered levels of metals (such as Cu and Zn) exist in the AD brain, and because Cu and Zn can be bound to the Abeta in the amyloid plaques, it is thought that these binding events in vivo may trigger or prevent Abeta amyloid formation in the AD brain. Although several structural models have been proposed, all of these are undefined due to the lack of definitive structural data. The present NMR studies utilized uniformly 15N-labeled Abeta(1-40) peptide and 1H-15N HSQC experiments and demonstrate for the first time that the Abeta binds Cu and Zn in a distinct manner. The binding promotes NH signal disappearance of E3-V18, which was not due to the paramagnetic effect of Cu2+, as identical NMR studies were seen with Zn2+, which is diamagnetic. NMR titration experiments showed that the amide NH peak intensities of R5-L17 showed the most pronounced intensity reduction, and that the 1H signals for the side chain aromatic signals of the three histidines shift upfield (H6, H13, and H14). We propose that initially Cu2+ is anchored to the Abeta monomer (fast exchange rate) and is followed by deprotonation and/or severe line broadening of the backbone amide NH for E3-V18 (intermediate exchange rate). By contrast, Cu2+ binding to soluble Abeta aggregates leads to rapid aggregation and nonfibrillar amorphous structures, and without metal, the Abeta can undergo the normal time-dependent aggregation, eventually producing more ordered, late-stage parallel beta-sheet structures. These anomalous (rare) binding events may account for some of the unique properties associated with the Abeta, such as its proposed "dual role", where sequestration of metal ions by the monomer is neuroprotective, while that by beta-aggregates generates oxygen radicals and causes neuronal death..'}}]}

Abstract: The assessment of functional capacity is essential for the diagnosis of dementia by DSM-IV criteria and has important implications for patient intervention and management. Although ratings of functional disability by family or other proxy informants are widely used by clinicians, there have been concerns and empirical evidence that potential reporter biases may result in either overestimation or underestimation of specific functional deficits. In this study, we compared family members' judgments of the functional abilities of seventy-two patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These judgments were compared to actual objective functional performance on an array of real-world tasks using the Direct Assessment of Functional Status (DAFS) scale. The results indicate that caregivers were extremely accurate in predicting the functional performance of AD patients who were not impaired during objective evaluation. In contrast, caregivers significantly overestimated the ability of impaired AD patients to tell time, to identify currency, to make change for a purchase, and to utilize eating utensils. Higher patient MMSE scores were associated with caregivers' overestimation of functional capacity, while the degree of caregivers' depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D depression scale, was not related to either overestimation or underestimation of patients' functional performance.."}}]}

Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, repeated assessments of cerebral metabolism and neuropsychological competence in early Alzheimer's disease. Regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose were measured with positron emission tomography and 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose on three occasions at 8-month intervals, in a 57-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease of 2 1/2 years' duration and with a family history of neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease. Data were compared with mean cerebral metabolic rates from 12 healthy men. No differences in regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose were found on the initial patient scan, whereas metabolism on the second and third scans was reduced significantly in the parietal lobes and bilaterally in some parietal lobe regions. Memory loss was demonstrable at the first scan, but then and at later scans, other aspects of cognitive performance remained within normal limits (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Boston Naming Test, Two-dimensional Block Construction). The results show that memory loss can precede a measurable reduction of cerebral metabolism in early Alzheimer's disease, but that later reductions in parietal lobe metabolism may not be accompanied by additional measurable neuropsychological deficits.."}}]}

2025-03-04 07:07:12,847 - INFO - Error in parsing the instance Title: Colostral proline-rich polypeptides--immunoregulatory properties and prospects of therapeutic use in Alzheimer's disease. Abstract: A proline-rich polypeptide complex (PRP), subsequently called Colostrinin(CLN), was first isolated from ovine colostrum, was shown to possess immunoregulatory properties, including effects on the maturation and differentiation of murine thymocytes and humoral and cellular immune responses, both in vivo and in vitro. PRP seems to restore balance in cellular immune functions and is not species specific. PRP is a complex of peptides of molecular masses ranging from 500 to 3000 Da. The polypeptide contains 25% proline and 40% hydrophobic amino acids. PRP shows a regulatory activity in cytokine (IFN, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10) induction and possesses the ability to inhibit the overproduction of oxygen reactive species and nitric oxide. Besides its immunoregulatory activity, PRP also showed psychotropic properties, improving cognitive activity and behavior of old rats, humans, and chickens. The properties of PRP prompted the authors to propose the complex for the treatment neurodegenerative disorders. Beneficial effects of PRP/Colostrinin were shown for the first time in double-blind placebo-controlled trials and long-term open-label studies. The results were confirmed in multicenter clinical trials. A very important property of PRP/Colostrinin is the prevention of Abeta aggregation and the disruption of already existing aggregates. The same properties were expressed by one of PRP's components, a nonapeptide (NP). Moreover, PRP modulates neurite outgrowth, suppresses uncontrolled activation of cells, reduces 4-HNE-mediated cellular damage, and modulates expression in cellular redox regulation, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Its biological response modifying activity can play an important role in its use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease..

2025-03-04 07:09:24,222 - INFO - Error in parsing the instance Title: Selective reduction of hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids to their hydroxy derivatives by apolipoprotein D: implications for lipid antioxidant activity and Alzheimer's disease. Abstract: ApoD (apolipoprotein D) is up-regulated in AD (Alzheimer's disease) and upon oxidative stress. ApoD inhibits brain lipid peroxidation in vivo, but the mechanism is unknown. Specific methionine residues may inhibit lipid peroxidation by reducing radical-propagating L-OOHs (lipid hydroperoxides) to non-reactive hydroxides via a reaction that generates MetSO (methionine sulfoxide). Since apoD has three conserved methionine residues (Met(49), Met(93) and Met(157)), we generated recombinant proteins with either one or all methionine residues replaced by alanine and assessed their capacity to reduce HpETEs (hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids) to their HETE (hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) derivatives. ApoD, apoD(M49-A) and apoD(M157-A) all catalysed the reduction of HpETEs to their corresponding HETEs. Amino acid analysis of HpETE-treated apoD revealed a loss of one third of the methionine residues accompanied by the formation of MetSO. Additional studies using apoD(M93-A) indicated that Met(93) was required for HpETE reduction. We also assessed the impact that apoD MetSO formation has on protein aggregation by Western blotting of HpETE-treated apoD and human brain samples. ApoD methionine oxidation was associated with formation of apoD aggregates that were also detected in the hippocampus of AD patients. In conclusion, conversion of HpETE into HETE is mediated by apoD Met(93), a process that may contribute to apoD antioxidant function..

2025-03-04 07:10:44,181 - INFO - Error in parsing the instance Title: Insulin and insulin-like growth factor expression and function deteriorate with progression of Alzheimer's disease: link to brain reductions in acetylcholine. Abstract: Reduced glucose utilization and energy metabolism occur early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlate with impaired cognition. Glucose utilization and energy metabolism are regulated by insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), and correspondingly, studies have shown that cognitive impairment may be improved by glucose or insulin administration. Recently, we demonstrated significantly reduced levels of insulin and IGF-I polypeptide genes and their corresponding receptors in advanced AD relative to aged control brains. The abnormalities in gene expression were accompanied by impaired survival signaling downstream through PI3 kinase-Akt. The present work characterizes the abnormalities in insulin and IGF gene expression and receptor binding in brains with different Braak stage severities of AD. Realtime quantitative RT-PCR analysis of frontal lobe tissue demonstrated that increasing AD Braak Stage was associated with progressively reduced levels of mRNA corresponding to insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II polypeptides and their receptors, tau, which is regulated by insulin and IGF-I, and the Hu D neuronal RNA binding protein. In contrast, progressively increased levels of amyloid beta protein precursor (AbetaPP), glial fibrillary acidic protein, and the IBA1/AIF1 microglial mRNA transcripts were detected with increasing AD Braak Stage. Impairments in growth factor and growth factor receptor expression and function were associated with increasing AD Braak stage dependent reductions in insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II receptor binding, ATP levels, and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) expression. Further studies demonstrated that: 1) ChAT expression increases with insulin or IGF-I stimulation; 2) ChAT is expressed in insulin and IGF-I receptor-positive cortical neurons; and 3) ChAT co-localization in insulin or IGF-I receptor-positive neurons is reduced in AD. Together, these data provide further evidence that AD represents a neuro-endocrine disorder that resembles a unique form of diabetes mellitus (? Type 3) and progresses with severity of neurodegeneration..

Abstract: We describe an improved method of measuring brain atrophy rates from serial MRI for multi-site imaging studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The method (referred to as KN-BSI) improves an existing brain atrophy measurement technique-the boundary shift integral (classic-BSI), by performing tissue-specific intensity normalization and parameter selection. We applied KN-BSI to measure brain atrophy rates of 200 normal and 141 AD subjects using baseline and 1-year MRI scans downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Baseline and repeat images were reviewed as pairs by expert raters and given quality scores. Including all image pairs, regardless of quality score, mean KN-BSI atrophy rates were 0.09% higher (95% CI 0.03% to 0.16%, p=0.007) than classic-BSI rates in controls and 0.07% higher (-0.01% to 0.16%, p=0.07) higher in ADs. The SD of the KN-BSI rates was 22% lower (15% to 29%, p<0.001) in controls and 13% lower (6% to 20%, p=0.001) in ADs, compared to classic-BSI. Using these results, the estimated sample size (needed per treatment arm) for a hypothetical trial of a treatment for AD (80% power, 5% significance to detect a 25% reduction in atrophy rate) would be reduced from 120 to 81 (a 32% reduction, 95% CI=18% to 45%, p<0.001) when using KN-BSI instead of classic-BSI. We concluded that KN-BSI offers more robust brain atrophy measurement than classic-BSI and substantially reduces sample sizes needed in clinical trials.."}}]}

Abstract: The use of Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers is supported in diagnostic criteria, but their maturity for clinical routine is still debated. Here, we evaluate brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET), a measure of cerebral glucose metabolism, as a biomarker to identify clinical and prodromal AD according to the framework suggested for biomarkers in oncology, using homogenous criteria with other biomarkers addressed in parallel reviews. FDG PET has fully achieved phase 1 (rational for use) and most of phase 2 (ability to discriminate AD subjects from healthy controls or other forms of dementia) aims. Phase 3 aims (early detection ability) are partly achieved. Phase 4 studies (routine use in prodromal patients) are ongoing, and only preliminary results can be extrapolated from retrospective observations. Phase 5 studies (quantify impact and costs) have not been performed. The results of this study show that specific efforts are needed to complete phase 3 evidence, in particular comparing and combining FDG PET with other biomarkers, and to properly design phase 4 prospective studies as a basis for phase 5 evaluations.."}}]}

A double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Mentane Study Group. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by cognitive and behavioral disturbances that are mediated in part by cholinergic brain deficits. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of an investigational cholinesterase inhibitor, that is, velnacrine maleate, in treating patients with clinically probable Alzheimer's disease (according to the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [Washington, DC]-Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association [Chicago, Ill]). METHODS: This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After a single-blind washout period, patients were randomized to receive placebo (n = 152), velnacrine maleate, 150 mg/d (n = 149), or velnacrine maleate, 225 mg/d (n = 148) for 24 weeks. Primary end points were cognitive behavior and memory components of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale and the Clinical Global Impression of Change scale. Secondary end points were caregiver-rated scales. RESULTS: The scores for the cognitive behavior and memory components of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale deteriorated in the placebo-treated group (P < .05) but not in the velnacrine-treated groups. Between-group comparisons favored velnacrine maleate, 225 mg over 150 mg (P < .05). Findings were similar for the Clinical Global Impression of Change scale and three of the four caregiver-rated scales. Treatment-related adverse clinical events occurred in 36%, 28%, and 30% of patients in the groups that received placebo, velnacrine maleate (150 mg), and velnacrine maleate (225 mg), respectively. The most common adverse clinical event was diarrhea, which rarely interrupted therapy. Treatment was stopped because of reversible abnormal liver function test results (five or more times the upper limits of normal) in 3%, 30%, and 24% of the patients who received placebo, velnacrine maleate (150 mg), and velnacrine maleate (225 mg), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Velnacrine produces modest but significant benefits in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Velnacrine maleate (225 mg) is more effective than 150 mg of velnacrine. Both dosages have acceptable safety profiles.."}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Many voxel-based morphometry studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) yielded not entirely consistent results. We conducted meta-analyses of gray matter anomalies to identify robust neuroanatomical changes between them. METHODS: A systematic review of voxel-based morphometry studies of patients with AD and MCI relative to healthy comparison subjects in PubMed, Embase databases from January 1995 to 29 April, 2011 was conducted. The anatomical distribution of the coordinates of gray matter differences was meta-analyzed using anatomical likelihood estimation (ALE). Separate maps of gray matter changes were constructed, and subtraction meta-analysis between AD and MCI was also performed. RESULTS: Thirty-five AD studies and twenty-four MCI studies were included in the meta-analysis. Extensive gray matter deficits were present in the medial temporal lobe (including entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampus, amygdala and uncus), thalamus, temporal, parietal, frontal and cingulate and insular cortices in AD. In MCI, gray matter reductions were identified in the medial temporal lobe (including entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampus, amygdala and uncus), temporal, thalamus, and cingulate cortex. Subtraction meta-analysis found more severe gray matter deficit mainly in the left medial lobe (including parahippocampus, amygdala and hippocampus). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis identified similar distributions of neuroanatomical changes in AD and MCI, which are consistent with the hierarchical model of neuropathological alterations of neurofibrillary tangles in AD and MCI. Subtraction analysis provided evidence that the left MTL may be a neuroanatomical marker to evaluate disease progression from MCI to AD.."}}]}

Abstract: Previous experiments demonstrated that transgenic mice carrying both amyloid precursor protein and mutant ATP7B transgenes reduce amyloid plaques and diminish plasma Abeta levels. These experiments showed that a structural change of ATP7B may affect Alzheimers disease (AD) susceptibility. In this study three missense SNPs in ATP7B gene (rs1801243, rs1801244, and rs1801249) were chosen to test whether they were associated with AD. We tested this hypothesis using a case control design. The experimental data showed that there was a significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for SNP rs1801249 (c.3419 T greater than C, Val1140Ala) in the case group (p = 0.014) but not in the control group and that there was an association between SNP rs1801249 and AD under a recessive model (p = 0.003). The data also showed that the genotype frequency distribution of the ATP7B c.1366 G greater than C polymorphism (rs1801244, Val456Leu) differed significantly between the AD patients and the normal subjects (p = 0.012). In addition, the frequency of the TGC haplotype of SNPs rs1801243, rs1801244, and rs1801249 was significantly higher in the AD patients compared with the normal subjects (p = 8.49x10-7). These observations suggested that genetic variations in the copper transporter gene ATP7B might contribute to AD pathogenesis in the Taiwanese population.."}}]}

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of intracerebroventricular injection of rAAV-HIF-1alpha on hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in a rat model of Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: Thirty-two male SD rats (250-300 g) were randomized into 4 groups (n=8), including the normal control group without any treatment, AD model group with right intracerebroventricular injection of 2 microl Abeta25-35 (10 mg/m1), sham-operated group with right intracerebroventricular injection of 2 microl normal saline, and AD+ rAAV-HIF-1alpha group with right intracerebroventricular injection of 10 microl rAAV-HIF-1a (1x1012 v.g./m1) one week after Abeta25-35 injection. The rats were sacrificed to detect the expression of HIF-1alpha and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons 5 weeks after Abeta25-35 or saline injection. RESULTS: Western blotting showed that the expression of HIF-1alpha was significantly higher in AD+rAAV-HIF-1alpha group (451.59+-34.39) than in normal control group (229.05+-41.28) and sham-operated group (216.29+-37.08) (P<0.05) without significant difference between the latter two groups. The apoptotic ratio of the hippocampal neurons was significantly higher in AD model group ([19.49+-2.59]%) than in normal control group ([5.41+-0.75]%) and sham-operated group ([5.28+-0.66]%) in (P<0.05), and intracerebroventricular injection of rAAV-HIF-1alpha resulted in a significant reduction of the apoptotic ratio in the AD rats ([12.07+-2.06]%) (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Intracerebroventricular injection of rAAV-HIF-1alpha can inhibit hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in the rat model of AD..'}}]}

Abstract: Previously, DJ-1 modulator UCP0054278/comp-B was identified by virtual screening, where comp-B interacts with DJ-1 to produce antioxidant and neuroprotective responses in Parkinson's disease models. However, the effect of comp-B in an in vivo Alzheimer's disease (AD) model is yet undetermined. Thus, we examined the effect of comp-B on spatial learning, memory, and amyloid-beta (Abeta) clearance in a transgenic mouse model of AD. We found that comp-B resolved the cognitive deficits, reduced insoluble Abeta42 levels, and prevented the degeneration of synaptic functions, thereby suggesting that comp-B may become a major compound for AD treatment.."}}]}

Abstract: Increasing evidence has shown the aberrant expression of inflammasome-related proteins in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain; these proteins, including NLRP1 inflammasome, are implicated in the execution of inflammatory response and pyroptotic death. Although current data are associated NLRP1 genetic variants with AD, the involvement of NLRP1 inflammasome in AD pathogenesis is still unknown. Using APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice, we found that cerebral NLRP1 levels were upregulated. Our in vitro studies further showed that increased NLRP1-mediated caspase-1-dependent 'pyroptosis' in cultured cortical neurons in response to amyloid-beta. Moreover, we employed direct in vivo infusion of non-viral small-interfering RNA to knockdown NLRP1 or caspase-1 in APPswe/PS1dE9 brain, and discovered that these NLRP1 or caspase-1 deficiency mice resulted in significantly reduced neuronal pyroptosis and reversed cognitive impairments. Taken together, our findings indicate an important role for NLRP1/caspase-1 signaling in AD progression, and point to the modulation of NLRP1 inflammasome as a promising strategy for AD therapy.."}}]}

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Although there are no drugs that modify the disease process, exposure to an enriched environment (EE) can slow the disease progression. Here, we characterize the effects of AD and EE on the post-transcriptional regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs), which may contribute to the detrimental and beneficial effects of AD and EE, respectively, on synaptic plasticity-related proteins and AD pathology. We found for the first time miRNAs that were inversely regulated in AD and EE, and may affect synaptic proteins and modulators, molecular factors associated with AD pathology, and survival and neuroprotective factors. MiRNAs that were upregulated only in 3xTgAD mice model of AD compared with their control mice were localized to synapses, predicted to downregulate essential synaptic proteins and are highly associated with regulating apoptosis, AD-associated processes and axon guidance. Studying the progressive change in miRNAs modulation during aging of 3xTgAD mice, we identified miRNAs that were regulated in earlier stages of AD, suggesting them as potential AD biomarkers. Last, we characterized AD- and EE-related effects in the mouse hippocampus on tomosyn protein levels, an inhibitor of the synaptic transmission machinery. While EE reduced tomosyn levels, tomosyn levels were increased in old 3xTgAD mice, suggesting a role for tomosyn in the impairment of synaptic transmission in AD. Interestingly, we found that miR-325 regulates the expression levels of tomosyn as demonstrated by a luciferase reporter assay, and that miR-325 was downregulated in AD and upregulated following EE. These findings improve our understanding of the molecular and cellular processes in AD pathology, following EE, and the interplay between the two processes, and open new avenues for the studies of understanding and controlling AD..

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is considered to be a risk factor for dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanism underlying this risk is not well understood. We examined gene expression profiles in postmortem human brains donated for the Hisayama study. Three-way analysis of variance of microarray data from frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and hippocampus was performed with the presence/absence of AD and vascular dementia, and sex, as factors. Comparative analyses of expression changes in the brains of AD patients and a mouse model of AD were also performed. Relevant changes in gene expression identified by microarray analysis were validated by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The hippocampi of AD brains showed the most significant alteration in gene expression profile. Genes involved in noninsulin-dependent DM and obesity were significantly altered in both AD brains and the AD mouse model, as were genes related to psychiatric disorders and AD. The alterations in the expression profiles of DM-related genes in AD brains were independent of peripheral DM-related abnormalities. These results indicate that altered expression of genes related to DM in AD brains is a result of AD pathology, which may thereby be exacerbated by peripheral insulin resistance or DM.."}}]}

Abstract: Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease through MRI neuroimaging biomarkers has been used as a complementary marker for traditional clinical markers to improve diagnostic accuracy and also help in developing new pharmacotherapeutic trials. It has been revealed that longitudinal analysis of the whole brain atrophy has the power of discriminating Alzheimer's disease and elderly normal controls. In this work, effect of involving intermediate atrophy rates and impact of using uncorrelated principal components of these features instead of original ones on discriminating normal controls and Alzheimer's disease subjects, is inspected. In fact, linear discriminative analysis of atrophy rates is used to classify subjects into Alzheimer's disease and controls. Leave-one-out cross-validation has been adopted to evaluate the generalization rate of the classifier along with its memorization. Results show that incorporating uncorrelated version of intermediate features leads to the same memorization performance as the original ones but higher generalization rate. As a conclusion, it is revealed that in a longitudinal study, using intermediate MRI scans and transferring them to an uncorrelated feature space can improve diagnostic accuracy.."}}]}

Abstract: Free radical-mediated damage to macromolecules and the resulting oxidative modification of different cellular components are a common feature of aging, and this process becomes much more pronounced in age-associated pathologies, including Alzheimer disease (AD). In particular, proteins are particularly sensitive to oxidative stress-induced damage and these irreversible modifications lead to the alteration of protein structure and function. In order to maintain cell homeostasis, these oxidized/damaged proteins have to be removed in order to prevent their toxic accumulation. It is generally accepted that the age-related accumulation of "aberrant" proteins results from both the increased occurrence of damage and the decreased efficiency of degradative systems. One of the most important cellular proteolytic systems responsible for the removal of oxidized proteins in the cytosol and in the nucleus is the proteasomal system. Several studies have demonstrated the impairment of the proteasome in AD thus suggesting a direct link between accumulation of oxidized/misfolded proteins and reduction of this clearance system. In this review we discuss the impairment of the proteasome system as a consequence of oxidative stress and how this contributes to AD neuropathology. Further, we focus the attention on the oxidative modifications of a key component of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, UCHL1, which lead to the impairment of its activity..'}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Today, dementias are diagnosed late in the course of disease. Future treatments have to start earlier in the disease process to avoid disability requiring new diagnostic tools. The objective of this study is to develop a new method for the differential diagnosis and identification of new biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using capillary-electrophoresis coupled to mass-spectrometry (CE-MS) and to assess the potential of early diagnosis of AD. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 159 out-patients of a memory-clinic at a University Hospital suffering from neurodegenerative disorders and 17 cognitively-healthy controls was used to create differential peptide pattern for dementias and prospective blinded-comparison of sensitivity and specificity for AD diagnosis against the Criterion standard in a naturalistic prospective sample of patients. Sensitivity and specificity of the new method compared to standard diagnostic procedures and identification of new putative biomarkers for AD was the main outcome measure. CE-MS was used to reliably detect 1104 low-molecular-weight peptides in CSF. Training-sets of patients with clinically secured sporadic Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy controls allowed establishing discriminative biomarker pattern for diagnosis of AD. This pattern was already detectable in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The AD-pattern was tested in a prospective sample of patients (n = 100) and AD was diagnosed with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 83%. Using CSF measurements of beta-amyloid1-42, total-tau, and phospho(181)-tau, AD-diagnosis had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 67% in the same sample. Sequence analysis of the discriminating biomarkers identified fragments of synaptic proteins like proSAAS, apolipoprotein J, neurosecretory protein VGF, phospholemman, and chromogranin A. CONCLUSIONS: The method may allow early differential diagnosis of various dementias using specific peptide fingerprints and identification of incipient AD in patients suffering from MCI. Identified biomarkers facilitate face validity for the use in AD diagnosis..

Sequence analysis of the discriminating biomarkers identified fragments of synaptic proteins like proSAAS, apolipoprotein J, neurosecretory protein VGF, phospholemman, and chromogranin A. CONCLUSIONS: The method may allow early differential diagnosis of various dementias using specific peptide fingerprints and identification of incipient AD in patients suffering from MCI. Identified biomarkers facilitate face validity for the use in AD diagnosis..

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Today, dementias are diagnosed late in the course of disease. Future treatments have to start earlier in the disease process to avoid disability requiring new diagnostic tools. The objective of this study is to develop a new method for the differential diagnosis and identification of new biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using capillary-electrophoresis coupled to mass-spectrometry (CE-MS) and to assess the potential of early diagnosis of AD. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 159 out-patients of a memory-clinic at a University Hospital suffering from neurodegenerative disorders and 17 cognitively-healthy controls was used to create differential peptide pattern for dementias and prospective blinded-comparison of sensitivity and specificity for AD diagnosis against the Criterion standard in a naturalistic prospective sample of patients. Sensitivity and specificity of the new method compared to standard diagnostic procedures and identification of new putative biomarkers for AD was the main outcome measure. CE-MS was used to reliably detect 1104 low-molecular-weight peptides in CSF. Training-sets of patients with clinically secured sporadic Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy controls allowed establishing discriminative biomarker pattern for diagnosis of AD. This pattern was already detectable in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The AD-pattern was tested in a prospective sample of patients (n = 100) and AD was diagnosed with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 83%. Using CSF measurements of beta-amyloid1-42, total-tau, and phospho(181)-tau, AD-diagnosis had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 67% in the same sample. Sequence analysis of the discriminating biomarkers identified fragments of synaptic proteins like proSAAS, apolipoprotein J, neurosecretory protein VGF, phospholemman, and chromogranin A.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by pathological hallmarks of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. The plaques are formed by aggregation and accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta), a cleavage fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Enhanced neuronal activity and seizure events are frequently observed in AD, and elevated synaptic activity promotes Abeta production. However, the mechanisms that link synaptic hyperactivity to APP processing and AD pathogenesis are not well understood. We previously found that Polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2), a homeostatic repressor of neuronal overexcitation, promotes APP beta-processing in vitro. Here, we report that Plk2 stimulates Abeta production in vivo, and that Plk2 levels are elevated in a spatiotemporally regulated manner in brains of AD mouse models and human AD patients. Genetic disruption of Plk2 kinase function reduces plaque deposits and activity-dependent Abeta production. Furthermore, pharmacological Plk2 inhibition hinders Abeta formation, synapse loss, and memory decline in an AD mouse model. Thus, Plk2 links synaptic overactivity to APP beta-processing, Abeta production, and disease-relevant phenotypes in vivo, suggesting that Plk2 may be a potential target for AD therapeutics.."}}]}

Abstract: The dominant hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) aetiology, the neuropathological guidelines for diagnosing AD and the majority of high-profile therapeutic efforts, in both research and in clinical practice, have been built around one possible causal factor, amyloid-beta (Abeta). However, the causal link between Abeta and AD remains unproven. Here, in the context of a detailed assessment of historical and contemporary studies, we raise critical questions regarding the role of Abeta in the definition, diagnosis and aetiology of AD. We illustrate that a holistic view of the available data does not support an unequivocal conclusion that Abeta has a central or unique role in AD. Instead, the data suggest alternative views of AD aetiology are potentially valid, at this time. We propose that an unbiased way forward for the field, beyond the current Abeta-centric approach, without excluding a role for Abeta, is required to come to an accurate understanding of AD dementia and, ultimately, an effective treatment.."}}]}

Abstract: It is evident that the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are derived from severe neuronal damage, and especially pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus are affected pathologically. Here, we analysed the proteome of hippocampal neurons, isolated from post-mortem brains by laser capture microdissection. By using (18)O labelling and mass spectrometry, the relative expression levels of 150 proteins in AD and controls were estimated. Many of the identified proteins are involved in transcription and nucleotide binding, glycolysis, heat-shock response, microtubule stabilization, axonal transport or inflammation. The proteins showing the most altered expression in AD were selected for immunohistochemical analysis. These analyses confirmed the altered expression levels, and showed in many AD cases a pathological pattern. For comparison, we also analysed hippocampal sections by Western blot. The expression levels found by this method showed poor correlation with the neuron-specific analysis. Hence, we conclude that cell-specific proteome analysis reveals differences in the proteome that cannot be detected by bulk analysis.."}}]}

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aggregates of a protein called, 'Abeta' found in brains of Alzheimer's patients are strongly believed to be the cause for neuronal death and cognitive decline. Among the different forms of Abeta aggregates, smaller aggregates called 'soluble oligomers' are increasingly believed to be the primary neurotoxic species responsible for early synaptic dysfunction. Since it is well known that the Abeta aggregation is a nucleation dependent process, it is widely believed that the toxic oligomers are intermediates to fibril formation, or what we call the 'on-pathway' products. Modeling of Abeta aggregation has been of intense investigation during the last decade. However, precise understanding of the process, pre-nucleation events in particular, are not yet known. Most of these models are based on curve-fitting and overlook the molecular-level biophysics involved in the aggregation pathway. Hence, such models are not reusable, and fail to predict the system dynamics in the presence of other competing pathways. RESULTS: In this paper, we present a molecular-level simulation model for understanding the dynamics of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide aggregation process involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed chemical kinetic theory based approach is generic and can model most nucleation-dependent protein aggregation systems that cause a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss the challenges in estimating all the rate constants involved in the aggregation process towards fibril formation and propose a divide and conquer strategy by dissecting the pathway into three biophysically distinct stages: 1) pre-nucleation stage 2) post-nucleation stage and 3) protofibril elongation stage. We next focus on estimating the rate constants involved in the protofibril elongation stages for Abeta42 supported by in vitro experimental data. This elongation stage is further characterized by elongation due to oligomer additions and lateral association of protofibrils (13) and to properly validate the rate constants involved in these phases we have presented three distinct reaction models. We also present a novel scheme for mapping the fluorescence sensitivity and dynamic light scattering based in vitro experimental plots to estimates of concentration variation with time. Finally, we discuss how these rate constants will be incorporated into the overall simulation of the aggregation process to identify the parameters involved in the complete Abeta pathway in a bid to understand its dynamics. CONCLUSIONS: We have presented an instance of the top-down modeling paradigm where the biophysical system is approximated by a set of reactions for each of the stages that have been modeled. In this paper, we have only reported the kinetic rate constants of the fibril elongation stage that were validated by in vitro biophysical analyses. The kinetic parameters reported in the paper should be at least accurate upto the first two decimal places of the estimate. We sincerely believe that our top-down models and kinetic parameters will be able to accurately model the biophysical phenomenon of Abeta protein aggregation and identify the nucleation mass and rate constants of all the stages involved in the pathway. Our model is also reusable and will serve as the basis for making computational predictions on the system dynamics with the incorporation of other competing pathways introduced by lipids and fatty acids.."}}]}

Abstract: Aging shows a decline in overall physical function, and cellular senescence is the powerful catalyst leading to aging. Considering that aging will be accompanied with the emergence of various aging-related diseases, research on new antiaging drugs is still valuable. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), as tools for intercellular communication, are important components of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and they can play pathological roles in the process of cellular senescence. In addition, EVs are similar to their original cells in functions. Therefore, EVs derived from pathological tissues or body fluids may be closely related to the progression of diseases and become potential biomarkers, while those from healthy cells may have therapeutic effects. Moreover, EVs are satisfactory drug carriers. At present, numerous studies have supported the idea that engineered EVs could improve drug targeting ability and utilization efficiency. Here, we summarize the characteristics of EVs and cellular senescence and focus on the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of EVs in various aging-related diseases, including Alzheimer disease, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and its complications, and skin aging..'}}]}

2025-03-04 07:21:57,205 - INFO - Error in parsing the instance Title: Pro-inflammatory protein S100A9 targeted by a natural molecule to prevent neurodegeneration onset. Abstract: Accumulation of the pro-inflammatory protein S100A9 has been implicated in neuroinflammatory cascades in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). S100A9 co-aggregates with other proteins such as alpha-synuclein in PD and Abeta in AD, contributing to amyloid plaque formation and neurotoxicity. The amyloidogenic nature of this protein and its role in chronic neuroinflammation suggest that it may play a key role in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Research into molecules targeting S100A9 could be a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent its amyloidogenic self-assembly and to attenuate the neuroinflammatory response in affected brain tissue. This work suggests that bioactive natural molecules, such as those found in the Mediterranean diet, may have the potential to alleviate neuroinflammation associated with the accumulation of proteins such as S100A9 in neurodegenerative diseases. A major component of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), hydroxytyrosol (HT), with its ability to interact with and modulate S100A9 amyloid self-assembly and expression, offers a compelling approach for the development of novel and effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of ND. The findings highlight the importance of exploring natural compounds, such as HT, as potential therapeutic options for these complex and challenging neurological conditions..

Abstract: No effective therapeutics to treat neurodegenerative diseases exist, despite significant attempts to find drugs that can reduce or rescue the debilitating symptoms of tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Pick's disease. A number of in vitro and in vivo models exist for studying neurodegenerative diseases, including cell models employing induced-pluripotent stem cells, cerebral organoids, and animal models of disease. Recent research has focused on microtubulestabilizing agents, either natural products or synthetic compounds that can prevent the axonal destruction caused by tau protein pathologies. Although promising results have come from animal model studies using brainpenetrant natural product microtubule-stabilizing agents, such as paclitaxel analogs that can access the brain, epothilones B and D, and other synthetic compounds such as davunetide or the triazolopyrimidines, early clinical trials in humans have been disappointing. This review aims to summarize the research that has been carried out in this area and discuss the potential for the future development of an effective microtubule stabilizing drug to treat neurodegenerative disease.."}}]}

Abstract: Brain-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) serve a prominent role in maintaining homeostasis and contributing to pathology in health and disease. This review establishes a crucial link between physiological processes leading to EV biogenesis and their impacts on disease. EVs are involved in the clearance and transport of proteins and nucleic acids, responding to changes in cellular processes associated with neurodegeneration, including autophagic disruption, organellar dysfunction, aging, and other cell stresses. In neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc.), EVs contribute to the spread of pathological proteins like amyloid beta, tau, alpha-synuclein, prions, and TDP-43, exacerbating neurodegeneration and accelerating disease progression. Despite evidence for both neuropathological and neuroprotective effects of EVs, the mechanistic switch between their physiological and pathological functions remains elusive, warranting further research into their involvement in neurodegenerative disease. Moreover, owing to their innate ability to traverse the blood-brain barrier and their ubiquitous nature, EVs emerge as promising candidates for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The review uniquely positions itself at the intersection of EV cell biology, neurophysiology, and neuropathology, offering insights into the diverse biological roles of EVs in health and disease.."}}]}

Abstract: Erythrocytes are deeply sensitive cells and important health indicators. During inflammatory response RBC, as a part of haematological system, are exposed to circulating inflammatory mediators and related oxidative stress. They present a highly specialized and organized cell membrane that interacts with inflammatory mediators and oxidative agents, leading to a variety of structural changes that promptly signal an abnormal situation. This review is aimed to provide an overview on erythrocyte involvement in physiological and pathological processes related to oxidative stress, such as aging, Down syndrome, neurodegenerative diseases, for instance Alzheimer Disease, erectile dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases. In particular this review will focus on the effects of oxidative stress on structural changes in the cell membrane and also on in the activity of erythrocyte enzymes such as membrane-bound, cytosolic glycohydrolases and RBC-eNOS. This review also underlines the potential clinical application of erythrocyte specific related parameters, which can be important tools not only for the study but also for the monitoring of several oxidative stress related diseases..'}}]}

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: In spite of the steady progress in the understanding of the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for the last 50 years, exceptionally few long-standing drugs are, at present, used for AD therapy. New interventions that either prevent, slow or stop the disease are urgently warranted to overcome the growing AD burden. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the currently existing preclinical and clinical evidence regarding new drug development and biomarkers for better understanding and focused management of AD. This article reviews the various potential and existing targets /receptors with valid biomarkers applied in recent years to address the early-stage tasks of the AD drug discovery process. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the relevant databases to identify studies published in recent years. In conclusion, the new approaches seem to aim at examining the prospective neuroprotective activity of disease-modifying drugs in the presymptomatic phases of AD, using biomarkers that detect progression of the disease before the growth of overt dementia.."}}]}

Abstract: The phenomenon of protein misfolding and aggregation has been widely associated with numerous human diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, systemic amyloidosis and type 2 diabetes, the vast majority of which remain incurable. To advance early stage drug discovery against these diseases, investigation of molecular libraries with expanded diversities and ultrahigh-throughput screening methodologies that allow deeper investigation of chemical space are urgently required. Toward this, we describe how Escherichia coli can be engineered so as to enable (1) the production of expanded combinatorial libraries of short, drug-like, head-to-tail cyclic peptides and (2) their simultaneous functional screening for identifying effective inhibitors of protein misfolding and aggregation using a genetic assay that links protein folding and misfolding to cell fluorescence. In this manner, cyclic peptides with the ability to inhibit pathogenic protein misfolding and/or aggregation can be readily selected by flow cytometric cell sorting in an ultrahigh-throughput fashion. This biotechnological approach accelerates significantly the identification of hit/lead molecules with potentially therapeutic properties against devastating diseases.."}}]}

Abstract: Stress granules (SGs) are membraneless organelles formed by eukaryotic cells in response to stress to promote cell survival through their pleiotropic cytoprotective effects. SGs recruit a variety of components to enhance their physiological function, and play a critical role in the propagation of pathological proteins, a key factor in neurodegeneration. Recent advances indicate that SG dynamic disorders exacerbate neuronal susceptibility to stress in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) including Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we outline the biological functions of SGs, highlight SG dynamic disorders in NDs, and emphasize therapeutic approaches for enhancing SG dynamics to provide new insights into ND intervention.."}}]}

Abstract: Sulforaphane (SFN) is a phytocompound belonging to the isothiocyanate family. Although it was also found in seeds and mature plants, SFN is mainly present in sprouts of many cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts. SFN is produced by the conversion of glucoraphanin through the enzyme myrosinase, which leads to the formation of this isothiocyanate. SFN is especially characterized by antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties, and for this reason, it aroused the interest of researchers. The aim of this review is to summarize the experimental studies present on Pubmed that report the efficacy of SFN in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, thanks to its beneficial effects, SFN could be useful as a supplement to counteracting neurodegenerative diseases.."}}]}

Abstract: Understanding the tissue-specific genetic controls of protein levels is essential to uncover mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene regulation. In this study, we generated a genomic atlas of protein levels in three tissues relevant to neurological disorders (brain, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma) by profiling thousands of proteins from participants with and without Alzheimer's disease. We identified 274, 127 and 32 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) for cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and brain, respectively. cis-pQTLs were more likely to be tissue shared, but trans-pQTLs tended to be tissue specific. Between 48.0% and 76.6% of pQTLs did not co-localize with expression, splicing, DNA methylation or histone acetylation QTLs. Using Mendelian randomization, we nominated proteins implicated in neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke. This first multi-tissue study will be instrumental to map signals from genome-wide association studies onto functional genes, to discover pathways and to identify drug targets for neurological diseases.."}}]}
